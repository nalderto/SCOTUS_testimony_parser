                <p class="short_transcript">The hearing will come to order, please.I welcome everyone here this morning,
                    Judge Bork, his distinguishedpanel of introducers, my colleagues, and the public, and Iwould like to
                    take just a moment at the outset to explain how weare going to proceed today and from here on, I
                    hope.It is the ordinary practice of the committee in a hearing likethis, Judge, to have opening
                    statements from all of my colleagues,and then to invite the presenters of the nominee to speak, and
                    thenask the nominee for his or her statement. But we are going tochange the beginning just a little
                    bit today to accommodate somevery busy and, quite frankly, very important people.Today, you have a
                    distinguished panel of introducers that arehere, and what I would like to suggest is this—and I have
                    checkedthis with my colleagues. I believe they are all in agreement. Eventhough every Senator will
                    have up to 10 minutes to make an openingstatement, I will for the time being forego my opening
                    statement;and I understand the distinguished ranking member, SenatorThurmond, will also. Then we
                    will yield to President Ford—andit is a great honor to have you here, Mr. President—and
                    distinguishedMembers of the Congress who will be introducing you.Then we will come back to opening
                    statements, either SenatorThurmond or Senator Kennedy, whomever wishes to proceed next,and finish
                    our opening statements. I suspect that after the introducersand the opening statements that will,
                    quite frankly, takethe better part of the morning. So I beg your indulgence, Judge, tosit through
                    all the flattering comments that you will hear and allthe questions that you may hear raised.Then we
                    will reconvene approximately an hour after we finish.My hope is we will finish by 1 o'clock or
                    earlier, and we will reconveneat 2 o'clock. At that time, I will make a brief opening statement.I
                    will invite you to make your statement, and at that timehopefully introduce your very lovely family
                    that I had an opportunityto meet just a few moments ago.If that is agreeable with my colleagues,
                    without any furtherwaste of time, I welcome you, Mr. President. It truly is an honor tohave you
                    here. As you know, on both sides of the aisle you havehad nothing but friends. We miss you here in
                    Washington. Quitefrankly, most of us envy you; not only that you have been
                    President[Laughter.]Senator Dole and I do not care much about that.But not only that you have been
                    President, but that you seem to beflourishing in the status of a former President as well.Mr.
                    President, please, your opening statement.STATEMENT OF HON. GERALD R. FORD</p>

                <strong>Gerald R. Ford Jr.</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, distinguished members of theSenate Committee on the Judiciary.
                    First, Mr. Chairman, I thankyou for your very kind and generous introduction. It is a very highhonor
                    and a very rare privilege for me to return to Capitol Hilland to appear before this distinguished
                    committee of the UnitedStates Senate.Although I never had the privilege of serving as a member of
                    theUnited States Senate, I did have the great honor of 25 V2 years as amember of the House of
                    Representatives. During my years in theHouse, my 9 months as President of the Senate, and 2V2 years
                    asPresident of the United States, I had an abiding respect for theSenate, especially its unique and
                    special responsibilities under theConstitution.In addition, in my 2&amp;xh years in the Nation's
                    capital, I developedwarm and treasured friendships with members of the Senate onboth sides of the
                    aisle. I am pleased to see some of these cherishedfriends on the panel on this occasion.My
                    appearance before the committee is for the purpose of introducingHon. Robert Bork, judge of the U.S.
                    Circuit Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia, who has been nominated byPresident Reagan for
                    service as an Associate Justice of the SupremeCourt of the United States.Under the Constitution,
                    article II, section 2, the President hasthe authority and the responsibility of nominating an
                    individualfor the position of Justice on the United States Supreme Court.The Senate, under article
                    II, section 2, has the duty of advise andconsent for presidential nominees to the Supreme
                    Court.During my service in the Presidency, I had the opportunity andthe honor to propose to the
                    Senate an individual for confirmationto serve on the nation's highest judicial body. I consider the
                    nominationof a Supreme Court Justice one of the most important responsibilitiesof a President of the
                    United States. It is vital that thenominee selected be of unquestioned character, broad training
                    inthe law, in-depth experience in the legal profession, and have a capabilityto analyze the facts
                    with objectivity and articulate one'sdecision on the basis of the law and the Constitution.It was my
                    honor and privilege as President to submit the nameof Judge John Paul Stevens to the Senate for
                    confirmation. Thethen U.S. Attorney General, Edward Levi, was invaluable in the selectionprocess to
                    fill this vacancy. We extensively reviewed JudgeStevens' background in private practice, as a U.S.
                    District Courtjudge, and as a judge of the Seventh Circuit of the Court of Appeals.Attorney General
                    Levi and I personally read a number of his deci.On the basis of his superb qualifications, I
                    submitted hisname to the Senate, and he was promptly and overwhelmingly con-firmed. I am very proud
                    of Justice Stevens' superb record on theSupreme Court for the past 12 years. While I have not
                    alwaysagreed with Justice Stevens, such differences in no way whatsoeverundercut my faith in his
                    effective and dedicated service on the SupremeCourt.Because I have such high regard for Justice
                    Stevens, I ampleased to note that on July 17, 1987, while attending a meeting oflawyers and judges
                    in Omaha, Nebraska, Justice Stevens statedthat Judge Bork, and I quote, "is a very well-qualified
                    candidateand one who will be a very welcome addition to the Court."I have known Judge Bork since the
                    mid-1960s when he was a distinguishedfaculty member of the Yale University Law School, myalma mater.
                    While teaching at the Yale Law School for 15 years,he held two endowed chairs in recognition of his
                    achievements as ascholar. He is an honored graduate of the University of ChicagoLaw School and
                    managing editor of the Law Review.Prior to law school, he served in the United States Marines
                    and,while in law school, interrupted his legal education for a secondMarine Corps tour. He had broad
                    experience in private practice asa partner with Kirkland &amp; Ellis, a nationally known
                    prestigiouslaw firm.My friendship with Robert Bork expanded during his service asSolicitor General,
                    1973-1977, while I was the Republican leader inthe House of Representatives, Vice President, and
                    President. Forthe record, he was unanimously confirmed as Solicitor General.Just months into the job
                    as Solicitor General, Robert Bork wasfaced with a crisis not of his own making. President Nixon,
                    duringthe Watergate investigation, ordered the dismissal of Special ProsecutorArchibald Cox. Judge
                    Bork, when thrust into a very difficultsituation, acted with integrity to preserve the continuity of
                    boththe Justice Department and the special prosecutor's investigatio.Ithink in retrospect that
                    history has shown that his performancewas in the Nation's interest.When I became President August 9,
                    1974, I requested that hestay on as Solicitor General, and he distinguished himself as theprincipal
                    government advocate before the Supreme Court duringmy administration. The Ford administration and
                    the nation benefitedenormously from this outstanding service.I was especially pleased that President
                    Reagan nominated RobertBork for judge of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Districtof
                    Columbia, and that the United States Senate confirmed himunanimously just 5 short years ago. In my
                    judgment, in my opinion,Judge Bork's record on the bench has been exemplary.There are four kinds of
                    occupations that a lawyer can have: privatepractitioner, law professor, government lawyer and
                    judge.Robert Bork has distinguished himself in not one, but in all fourendeavors. A renowned Federal
                    Appeals Court judge, former SolicitorGeneral of the United States, professor of law at Yale
                    University,and twice a partner in one of the nation's leading law firms.Judge Robert Bork is
                    uniquely qualified to sit on the UnitedStates Supreme Court. It is, therefore, my distinct honor and
                    greatpleasure to introduce to this distinguished committee a man who,as Chief Justice Burger noted,
                    may well be the most qualifiednominee to the Supreme Court in more than half a century.Mr. Chairman
                    and members of this distinguished committee ofthe United States Senate, I strongly urge affirmative
                    committeeconsideration and favorable approval by the U.S. Senate.Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, Iam certainly pleased to have
                    this brief opportunity—and I will bebrief. I know the committee has a lot of work to do.I want to
                    thank my former House colleague and friend for over25 years, President Ford, for being here this
                    morning. I think hispresence adds a great deal to this hearing. He does have the respectof
                    Republicans and Democrats and has always had it, as faras I can recall. So I am certainly pleased to
                    see him again. I agreewith the comments made earlier by the chairman about formerPresidents and
                    future Presidents.I am very pleased to be here for a couple of reasons. There ismore than a little
                    fortuity in the timing and location of these hearingsbecause in 2 days we will be celebrating in
                    Philadelphia thebicentennial of our Constitution. That Constitution established, ofcourse, three
                    branches of government—the executive, the legislative,and the judicial—each with a role to play in
                    governing ournation.All through this past summer in this very room, members ofCongress explored the
                    complex and dynamic relationship betweenthe executive and the legislative branches of our
                    Government. Inthe process of doing this, they raised the level of public debate onthat
                    relationship.Now, the committee will explore a different aspect of our constitutionalsystem: the
                    proper scope of the Senate's role in the selectionof Supreme Court Justices.In Judge Robert Bork,
                    the President has found a man of unquestionableability and integrity. His professional background
                    madehim a leading and obvious candidate for the Supreme Court evenbefore Justice Powell
                    resigned.Those who have opposed his nomination and may oppose hisnomination in the future, in my
                    view, have conceded that much.Many have focused their attention on his ideology. In doing so,they
                    have found different reasons why they now must oppose, orwhy they might oppose in the future, Judge
                    Bork.I think this hearing is going to be of tremendous significance. Weare all politicians, and we
                    know that 1988 is next year. But I havegot to believe that Republicans and Democrats alike, members
                    ofthis committee, take this responsibility very seriously. There aregoing to be some tough
                    questions. Judge Bork knows that. JudgeBork is prepared for that. I believe, in the final analysis,
                    he isgoing to be the key factor in this whole confirmation process.Some of us have indicated our
                    support, and some of us have indicatedour opposition. But I have been pleased with what I see
                    developing.I think we are going to have a very objective effort bythis committee. And I would hope
                    when this nomination comes tothe Senate floor—as I believe it will—that we can move with dis-patch
                    and keep the debate on the same high plane. I know that isgoing to be the effort of the
                    distinguished chairman and the distinguishedranking member, Senator Thurmond, and others who willbe
                    involved in that debate. I would hope that as part of the leadership,I can be of assistance along
                    with Senator Byrd.There are a number of issues that do not lend themselves to easyanswers or instant
                    analysis. They certainly do not lend themselvesto slogans or statistics.I would ask the committee
                    and the American people to take thetime to understand Judge Bork's approach to the Constitution.That
                    approach is based upon "judicial restraint," the principle thatjudges are supposed to interpret the
                    law and not make it.Now, Judge Bork did not invent this concept. It has been aroundfor a long time.
                    One of the most eloquent advocates was OliverWendell Holmes.Similarly, his views on many cases are
                    not original. As I understand,and I have not read all the articles, but his writings on theright to
                    privacy are difficult to distinguish from those of HugoBlack.There are many similarities, and I am
                    certain the committee willgo into it case-by-case, Law Review-by-Law Review; they will makethe final
                    determination.Now, it has been some time since this nomination was made. Iwould say at the outset
                    some of us were critical of that. But Iwould guess in retrospect it may have taken that much time,
                    withthe August recess, to prepare for this very important hearing.There is tremendous interest in
                    the Bork nomination across thecountry. Wherever you go, and some of us go a lot of places, this
                    isgenerally question no.1 or no. 2 in any town meeting in America.So the American people are tuned
                    in. The American people areready for a fair and impartial, tough hearing. I have got to say,Judge
                    Bork, you are probably going to have one. And I know youare prepared for it. I want to join my
                    colleagues here to indicatemy appreciation for having an opportunity to help introduce JudgeBork
                    this morning.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, andmembers of the committee. Normally,
                    Presidential nominees askSenators from their home State to present them to Senate committ.Judge Bork
                    resides in the District of Columbia, so he hasturned to the next available option and has asked a
                    former studentof his to be here today.His first year on the faculty of Yale Law School was my
                    finalyear as a student there. He taught me all I ever knew about antitrust.For those who wonder
                    about his compassion and humanity, Ipassed Professor Bork's course.Mr. Chairman, I am genuinely
                    honored to be here today. Twentyfiveyears after that law school class, my memories are dim aboutthe
                    details of antitrust law, but I have a clear recollection of BobBork, the teacher. Even in his first
                    class, he was a first-rate professor.He has since told me that he was panicked when he stoodbefore
                    that class. He certainly did not show it. By every indication,he loved teaching. His eyes sparkled;
                    so did his sense of humor. Hedelighted in saying things to provoke responses from his students.Far
                    from playing the self-important pedagogue, Bob Bork delightedin the give-and-take of the classroom
                    in the clash of ideas.He did not require us to receive his thoughts as revealed truth.He taught us
                    to think for ourselves. He held strong views; everygood law professor does. But he used those views
                    to evoke a responsefrom his students. He encouraged argument. He respecteddissent. This to him was
                    the joy of classroom teaching.Judge Bork has said that his own philosophy of the law hasevolved over
                    the 25 years since I knew him in class. He is the bestone to explain just how that evolution
                    occurred, and I am sure hewill do just that, clearly and unequivocally.My point is simply this:
                    Those who say that Judge Bork is an unyieldingideologue are not describing the man I know. In my
                    experience,unyielding ideologues do not resemble Judge Bork. They donot encourage dissent; they do
                    not have a sense of humor; and theydo not evolve in their own thinking.Mr. Chairman, having made
                    these comments about Judge Bork,the person, I do not believe that the Senate's decision will
                    orshould be made on the basis of personality. The issue before us isfar more fundamental and far
                    more important than that.In this confirmation, we in the Senate will be expressing ourviews on the
                    role and power of the U.S. Supreme Court. Thestraightforward issue is the readiness of the Court to
                    strike downthe acts of the legislative branch of government, federal or State.The power of the Court
                    to nullify legislation is restrained only bythe Court itself. As Justice Hughes once said, "The
                    Constitution iswhat the judges say it is."A court which is willing to read novel meanings into the
                    Constitutionhas the power to do so. Judge Bork is an advocate of judicialrestraint. His view, as I
                    understand it, is this: If the Supreme Courtstrikes down a legislative act, its decision must be
                    based on soundlegal reasoning, not on the personal opinions of the Court aboutthe wisdom of the
                    legislation dressed up in legal terminology.Judge Bork's judicial philosophy is open to fair debate
                    by ablepeople of good will. I happen to agree with Judge Bork's view ofjudicial restraint; some do
                    not. Some believe that the Court shouldstand at the ready to supplant legislative opinion with its
                    own.Whether one agrees with Judge Bork or disagrees with him, hisis not a novel position. It
                    reaffirms the faith we place in the democraticprocess. Judge Bork stands on a highly respectable
                    tradition,including such giants as Justice Frankfurter and his late colleagueat Yale, Professor
                    Alexander Bickel. He would state his positionwith great intellectual force in the Supreme Court, but
                    with goodhumor and civility.Mr. Chairman, in this bicentennial year of the Constitution, theSenate
                    now commences a most important debate. It is not aboutJudge Bork, the person, however much I like
                    and respect him. It isabout the power of the Supreme Court and how, if at all, it shouldrestrain
                    that power.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of this distinguishedcommittee. I
                    greatly appreciate your courtesy in invitingme to participate in these very important proceedings.
                    Up to now, Idid not realize why I was invited, but having heard the reasons forthe other people
                    being present, I realize that in this ecumenicalspirit they wanted one Harvard graduate on this
                    panel.Like yourself, as a Member of Congress who serves on the HouseJudiciary Committee, I naturally
                    have a strong and abiding interestin the quality, effectiveness and constitutional legitimacy of
                    ourfederal judiciary. There are many relevant factors to consider inconnection with an individual
                    nominated to serve on the UnitedStates Supreme Court. Obviously, this includes intellect,
                    legaltraining, practical legal experience, demonstrated professional competenceand personal
                    integrity. A record of legal scholarship, whilehistorically not always a prerequisite, is also an
                    important considerationwhen relevant.Finally, and very importantly, if the nominee has prior
                    judicialexperience—what does that record reveal both in terms of legalsoundness and judicial
                    temperament? But that is what the Senateconfirmation process is about: reviewing these factors,
                    hearing bothsides on the merits of a particular nominee, and ultimately decidingin the best
                    interests of our nation.Certainly, no one can look at the career of Judge Bork withoutbeing
                    impressed with his extraordinary credentials. A graduate ofthe University of Chicago Law School, a
                    Phi Beta Kappa and managingeditor of that institution's Law Review, Robert Bork hastwice served on
                    the faculty of Yale Law School and was a professorat that prestigious institution for a total of 15
                    years. Mr. Bork, asyou have been told, has also been in the private practice of law onnumerous
                    occasions during his career and earned a national reputationas an outstanding litigator. From 1973
                    to 1977, Robert Borkwas Solicitor General of the United States, a job universally recognizedas one
                    requiring the talents of a "lawyer's lawyer."Since 1982, Robert Bork has served as judge on the
                    Circuit Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia and during that time has,in my judgment,
                    accumulated a remarkable record; a record, I respectfullysubmit, that should be most relevant to
                    this committee'sconsideration. Of the 426 cases in which he has participated, JudgeBork has been the
                    author of the majority opinion in 106 instances.With respect to those 106 majority opinions, it is
                    deserving of emphasisthat he never has been reversed by the Supreme Court. Furthermore,of the 401
                    cases in which Judge Bork joined with the majority,none have been reversed by the U.S. Supreme
                    Court.In addition, Judge Bork authored dissenting opinions in 25 remainingcases, and the Supreme
                    Court adopted the viewpoint expressedby Judge Bork in those dissents on six different occasions.Many
                    have offered the observation that Judge Bork may well havethe most remarkable record on appeal of
                    any currently sitting U.S.Federal judge. I think it is a fair conclusion from these statisticsthat
                    Judge Bork's judicial rulings during these 5 years have notbeen at variance with the prevailing
                    views of the current SupremeCourt.Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I find it personally difficult to
                    reconcilesome of the charges that have been leveled against Judge Borkwith his record since becoming
                    an appellate federal judge. His judicialphilosophy, in practice as well as in theory, is fully
                    consistentwith traditional American legal thought. For Robert Bork, the roleof the judge is to apply
                    the intent of the legislature to a legal factsituation. Following the President's nomination of
                    Judge Bork tothe Supreme Court, I reviewed a number of his opinions in the Districtof Columbia
                    Circuit Court with particular emphasis on mattersof great concern to me—the first amendment and
                    civil rightscases. Those cases demonstrate that, in application, the result ofJudge Bork's
                    philosophy can often be civil libertarian in nature.They certainly do not disclose a view that our
                    Constitution shouldbe other than contemporary and workable in a modern society.1From his
                    perspective, a judge may not insert his own personalpreferences or political philosophy into a case.
                    The media calls itexercising "judicial restraint," but Judge Bork states it more clearlyas the
                    intellectual rejection of "judicial imperialism." That is theterm he applies to judges who would
                    substitute their private personalphilosophy or private political views for that of the
                    legislatorswho actually wrote the laws. He recognizes that judges are notelected and that under our
                    system of government, it is the electedrepresentatives that write and amend the laws.He asks the
                    following kinds of questions: What does the Statutesay? Does the statute permit a government agency,
                    a private organization,or an individual to act in a particular manner? Do theregulations issued by
                    the agency reflect the statutory authoritygiven to that agency? Does the language of the
                    Constitution allowthe outcome sought by the litigant in this particular case? These,to me, do not
                    sound like the questions of someone outside therealm of traditional American legal thought. More
                    specifically,they sound exactly like the types of questions that a judge ought toask.I have every
                    confidence that these proceedings will allow the distinguishedmembers of this committee to probe and
                    to analyze theremarkable qualifications of this outstanding lawyer and judge.Robert Bork deserves to
                    be judged for the lawyer he actually is andon the basis of how he actually rendered judicial
                    decisions. Thesehearings afford an opportunity to elicit his views directly ratherthan leave the
                    record to theoretical speculation.Mr. Chairman, this man is qualified to be an Associate Justice
                    ofthe Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of virtuallyevery logical criterion. He was an
                    excellent courtroom lawyer, is awidely recognized scholar, and has had an exceptional record as
                    anappellate jurist. I urge this committee, as I know that it will, tojudge this man fairly and to
                    review all the facts in this case beforea final judgment is rendered. Thank you.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Mr. Chairman, I have had the pleasure of
                    serving with you onthis committee, with me as chairman and you as ranking member.I have always found
                    you to be fair, courteous and considerate, andI am sure that is the way this hearing will be
                    held.Judge Bork, I would like to welcome you and your family heretoday. I think it particularly
                    fitting that the Senate in performingits constitutional duty is considering your nomination to be an
                    AssociateJustice of the Supreme Court at the time we are celebratingthe 200th anniversary of the
                    Constitution of the United States.Today, the committee begins consideration of this
                    importantnomination of Judge Robert H. Bork to be an Associate Justice ofthe Supreme Court. This is
                    the fourth Supreme Court nominationthat this committee has considered in the past 6 years. In fact,
                    Imight say that it is the 20th such nomination that I have had theopportunity to review during my 33
                    years in the Senate. On earlieroccasions, I have set forth the qualities I believe a nominee to
                    theCourt should possess:First, unquestioned integrity; the courage to render decisions inaccordance
                    with the Constitution and the will of the people as expressedin the laws of Congress;A keen
                    knowledge and understanding of the law; in other words,professional competency;Compassion, which
                    recognizes both the rights of the individualand the rights of society in the quest for equal justice
                    under law;Proper judicial temperament; the ability to prevent the pressuresof the moment from
                    overpowering the composure and self-disciplineof a well-ordered mind;An understanding of and
                    appreciation for the majesty of oursystem of government—in its separation of powers between
                    thebranches of our federal government; its division of powers betweenthe federal and State
                    governments; and the reservation to theStates and to the people of all powers not delegated to the
                    federalgovernment.There is no doubt that the nominee before us today meets thesequalifications. His
                    intellectual credentials are impeccable: Phi BetaKappa, distinguished professor of law at Yale Law
                    School; and respectedauthor. His experience is extraordinary: in academia, as ageneral practitioner,
                    as Solicitor General, and as a judge for theU.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, felt by many
                    to be thesecond most important court in this country. Judge Bork has along-standing reputation for
                    integrity and judicial temperament.On two occasions, Judge Bork has had his professional
                    qualificationsand personal character specifically examined and carefullyscrutinized by the American
                    Bar Association. On both occasions,the ABA has given Judge Bork the highest possible rating for
                    hisprofessional competence, integrity, and temperament.Judge Bork is not a new or unknown
                    quantity.He has beenbefore this committee twice previously, and both times the committeeand the full
                    Senate have deemed him worthy of confirmation:to be Solicitor General and to be a judge of the U.S.
                    Court of Appealsfor the D.C. Circuit. It is also worthy of note that both timesJudge Bork was
                    confirmed by the full Senate—once when Democratscontrolled the Senate and once when Republicans
                    did—therewas not a single dissenting vote.In fact, if we were to put aside questions of philosophy
                    and ideology,Judge Bork would in all likelihood already be sitting on theCourt. However, it is
                    apparent that some would have the issue ofphilosophy become the standard for whether or not we
                    confirm thisnominee for the Supreme Court. This nomination has been delayedlonger, by any standard,
                    than any other Supreme Court nominationin the last 25 years, while opponents mount an
                    ideologicalcampaign against him. Because so much has been said about thequestion of philosophy and
                    ideology, I believe we should examinethat issue within the context of the nominating process.Some
                    have said that philosophy should not be considered at allin the confirmation process. In fact, I
                    have been incorrectly alignedwith that position. Others say that philosophy should be the
                    solecriteria. I reject both of these positions. I believe that a candidate'sphilosophy may properly
                    be considered, but philosophy should notbe the sole criteria for rejecting a nominee with one
                    notable exception.The one exception is when the nominee clearly does not supportthe basic,
                    long-standing consensus principles of our nation.I want to be very clear about this point: I do not
                    believe that philosophyalone should bar a nominee from the Court unless thatnominee holds a belief
                    that is so contrary to the fundamental, longstandingprinciples of this country that the nominee's
                    servicewould be inconsistent with the very essence of this country'sshared values.Such a nominee's
                    position should be unequivocal and in violationof a basic belief. For example, freedom of speech is
                    a fundamental,accepted principle in this country; but exactly what constitutes"speech" and whether
                    or not there are limitations on any particularactivity, are issues on which reasonable people can
                    disagree.Freedom of religion is an accepted tenet of this country; but whetherfreedom of religion
                    means that a person in the military canwear religious garb rather than his uniform is a matter that
                    canbe, and is, openly debated. That there should be no government-establishedreligion in America is
                    a fundamental principle; butwhether that proscribed prayer in our schools is a matter of
                    acceptedpublic debate and commentary. That discrimination based onrace or national origin is
                    unacceptable is a basic tenet of thisnation; but there certainly is no such agreement on the use of
                    preferentialquotas.I raise these examples not to launch into a substantive debate onany of these
                    issues, but merely to point out that we should not confusecore, fundamental principles with evolving
                    and debatable applicationsof those principles.In applying this standard, which could lead to
                    automatic rejectionof a nominee, we must be reasonable. We must apply it in amanner which also
                    protects the basic American interest of free andopen debate on important issues. As the courts, and
                    all Americans,grappled with new applications of our principles and new doctrinesare created and
                    offered, these evolving decisions are not sacrosanctand above criticism. In fact, debate and
                    discussion of these newideas is not only welcomed, it is essential. This is a stringent standard,but
                    in my tenure in the Senate, this test has never been usedto disqualify a nominee because no
                    President has ever sent such anominee to the Senate. To apply a broader philosophical litmustest
                    would put a nominee in jeopardy of being labeled "un-American"or "unfit" if he has ever been in a
                    minority position on anyissue.It has been said that since the President uses philosophy to picka
                    nominee, the Senate can use philosophy in evaluating a nominee.A corollary statement should be just
                    as true. When the Presidentdoes not solely use philosophy to choose his nominee, the Senateshould
                    not solely use philosophy to reject that nominee. Historically,Presidents do consider philosophy
                    when appointing nominees tothe Supreme Court. That is part of our system of government; it isthe
                    manner in which the American people have an opportunity toinfluence the Court. But this President
                    was re-elected overwhelminglywhen the issue of such appointments was a major, well-discussedcampaign
                    issue.Because this process is well understood by the American people,any nominee selected by a
                    President comes to the Senate with apresumption in his favor. Accordingly, opponents of the
                    nomineemust make the case against him. That is why opponents of JudgeBork are trying to fit him into
                    some accepted basis for disqualificationor create a new one to defeat him.First, Judge Bork's
                    opponents will try to raise questions abouthis character and integrity. Failing this, they will
                    assert that he isdisqualified by virtue of his philosophy, by labeling him as an extremistor
                    "outside the mainstream." This, in essence, refers to thepurely philosophical test which I have
                    discussed. A review of JudgeBork's record indicates that he, indeed, is well within the mainstreamof
                    legal debate and discussion in this country. His record onappeals is perhaps the best in the
                    country.However, even if a nominee occasionally dissents from a majorityview, that should not
                    disqualify him. Although Judge Bork hasbeen in the accepted majority position almost without fail,
                    there isa grand tradition of legal dissent in this country. As Justice FelixFrankfurter said, "In
                    this Court, dissents have gradually becomemajority opinions." There certainly is nothing wrong with
                    writinga dissent at any judicial level if it is called for; in fact, integritydemands it.Opponents
                    of this nominee have also surfaced a new theory of"balance" on the Court; that somehow there is a
                    mandated immutablebalance on the Court. This theory has an inherent problem:When did the Court reach
                    the perfect balance? Was it in theWarren Court, or the courts which preceded the Warren Court
                    andwhich were so greatly overturned by the Warren Court?Further, does anyone really believe that
                    these proponents of a"balance theory" would oppose a liberal nominee solely because hehad been named
                    to replace a conservative Justice? Of course not.More fundamentally, such a theory presupposes that
                    the SupremeCourt is infallible, when clearly it is not. Do we really want to enshrine,for all time,
                    every decision the Court makes? History givesus many examples of the Supreme Court overruling itself
                    and correctingits own errors. Usually, those who argue "balance" havecertain decisions they do not
                    want reconsidered under any circumstances.On the other hand, I believe the Court should be allowedto
                    correct errors it has made.Finally, there is one other issue that should be addressed. I believe,as
                    I have stated before, that the full Senate should make thefinal determination on all nominations.
                    The confirmation processshould not stop at the committee level. The Constitution requiresthe advice
                    and consent of the Senate, not simply the opinion of anyone committee. I am pleased that both
                    Chairman Biden and thedistinguished majority leader, among others, have indicated thatthey agree
                    that this nomination should be dealt with by the fullSenate.Judge Bork, welcome again to the
                    committee, and we look forwardto your testimony.</p>

                    standards forour highest Court. We insist that a nominee should have outstandingability and
                    integrity. But we also insist on even more: thatthose who sit on the Supreme Court must deserve the
                    special titlewe reserve for only nine federal judges in the entire country, thetitle that sums up in
                    one word the awesome responsibility on theirshoulders—the title of "Justice."Historically, America
                    has set this high standard because the Justicesof the Supreme Court have a unique obligation: to
                    serve asthe ultimate guardians of the Constitution, the rule of law, and theliberty and the quality
                    of every citizen. To fulfill these responsibilities,to earn the title of "Justice," a person must
                    have specialqualities:A commitment to individual liberty as the cornerstone of Americandemocracy.A
                    dedication to equality for all Americans, especially those whohave been denied their full measure of
                    freedom, such as womenand minorities.A respect for justice for all whose rights are too readily
                    abusedby powerful institutions, whether by the power of government orby giant concentrations of
                    power in the private sector.A Supreme Court Justice must also have respect for the SupremeCourt
                    itself, for our constitutional system of government, and forthe history and heritage by which that
                    system has evolved, includingthe relationship between the federal government and theStates, and
                    between Congress and the President.Indeed, it has been said that the Supreme Court is the umpire
                    ofthe federal system because it has the last word about justice inAmerica. Above all, therefore, a
                    Supreme Court nominee must possessthe special quality that enables a justice to render justice.
                    Thisis the attribute whose presence we describe by the words such asfairness, impartiality,
                    open-mindedness, and judicial temperament,and whose absence we call prejudice or bias.These are the
                    standards by which the Senate must evaluate anyjudicial nominee. And by these standards, Robert Bork
                    falls shortof what Americans demand of a man or woman as a Justice on theSupreme Court. Time and
                    again, in his public record over morethan a quarter of a century, Robert Bork has shown that he is
                    hostileto the rule of law and the role of the courts in protecting individualliberty.He has harshly
                    opposed—and is publicly itching to overrule—many of the great decisions of the Supreme Court that
                    seek to fulfillthe promise of justice for all Americans.He is instinctively biased against the
                    claims of the average citizenand in favor of concentrations of power, whether that is governmentalor
                    private.And in conflicts between the legislative and executive branchesof government, he has
                    repeatedly expressed a clear contempt forCongress and an unbridled trust in the power of the
                    President.Mr. Bork has said many extreme things in his comments of alifetime in the law. We already
                    have a more extensive record of hiswork and writings than perhaps we have had for any other
                    SupremeCourt nominee in history.It is easy to conclude from the public record of Mr. Bork's
                    publishedviews that he believes women and blacks are second-classcitizens under the Constitution. He
                    even believes that, in the relationto the executive, Members of Congress are second-class
                    citizens,yet he is asking the Senate to confirm him.The strongest case against this nomination is
                    made by the wordsof Mr. Bork himself. In an article he wrote in 1963, during thebattle to
                    desegregate lunch counters, motels, hotels, and otherpublic accommodations in America, he referred
                    to the civil rightsprinciple underlying that historic struggle as a principle of
                    unsurpassedugliness.Ten years later, he recanted his opposition, but in the time sincethen he has
                    consistently demonstrated his hostility towards equaljustice for all.As recently as June of this
                    year, he ridiculed a Supreme Courtdecision prohibiting sex discrimination and suggested that the
                    ex34tension of the equal protection clause to women trivializes the Constitution.In Robert Bork's
                    America, there is no room at the inn for blacksand no place in the Constitution for women, and in
                    our Americathere should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork.Mr. Bork has been equally
                    extreme in his opposition to the rightto privacy. In an article in 1971, he said, in effect, that a
                    husbandand wife have no greater right to privacy under the Constitutionthan a smokestack has to
                    pollute the air.President Reagan has said that this controversy is pure politics,but that is not the
                    case. I and others who oppose Mr. Bork haveoften supported nominees to the Supreme Court by
                    RepublicanPresidents, including many with whose philosophy we disagree. Ivoted for the confirmation
                    of Chief Justice Burger and also JusticesBlackmun, Powell, Stevens, O'Connor and Scalia. But Mr.
                    Bork is anominee of a different stripe. President Reagan has every right totake Mr. Bork's
                    reactionary ideology into account in making thenomination, and the Senate has every right to take
                    that ideologyinto account in acting on the nomination.Now, Mr. Bork's supporters are understandably
                    seeking tochange his spots and deflect attention from the public record of hiscontroversial career.
                    He will have ample opportunity in these hearingsto explain, or explain away, the extraordinarily
                    extreme andbiased positions he has taken. But a switch at a convenient timeshould not be sufficient
                    to make Mr. Bork one of the nine.Some observers are predicting a bitter battle over this
                    nominationand have suggested that the struggle is reminiscent of thegreat confrontations over civil
                    rights and equal justice in the past.But those confrontations were inevitable and irrepressible.
                    AllAmericans should realize that the confrontation over this nominationis the result of a deliberate
                    decision by the Reagan administration.Rather than selecting a real judicial conservative to fill
                    JusticePowell's vacancy, the President has sought to appoint an activistof the right whose agenda
                    would turn us back to the battles of abitterly divided America, reopening issues long thought to be
                    settledand wounds long thought to be healed.I for one am proud of the accomplishments of America in
                    movingtowards the constitutional ideas of liberty and equality and justiceunder law. I am also proud
                    of the role of the Senate in ensuringthat Supreme Court nominees adhere to the tradition of
                    fairness,impartiality, and freedom from bias.I believe the American people strongly reject the
                    administration'sinvitation to roll back the clock and relive the more troubledtimes of the past. I
                    urge the committee and the Senate to reject thenomination of Mr. Bork.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you. I want to welcome you to the committee,Judge Bork, and I would
                    just state that I think it is importantthat potential Justices be treated with fairness too; not
                    withinflammatory mis-characterizations; not with distorted statistics;not with misleading
                    methodology leading up to these type of statementsand statistics, and certainly not with the
                    selective use of evidence,a lot of which I have seen by your critics in this particularmatter.Mr.
                    Chairman, I feel honored to welcome to the committee one ofthe most qualified individuals ever
                    nominated to serve on theUnited States Supreme Court. His resume—outstanding law student,successful
                    trial practitioner, leading law professor, esteemedauthor and lecturer, excellent Solicitor General,
                    and respectedjudge on the District of Columbia Circuit—speaks for itself.Nonetheless a few details
                    might demonstrate the quality of hislife's work. He was not merely one of the top law students at
                    theUniversity of Chicago, but he was the managing editor of the LawReview, as has been stated. He
                    was not merely one of the top lawprofessors for 15 years, but the holder of two endowed chairs.
                    Hewas not merely an excellent Solicitor General, but successfully representedthe United States
                    before the Supreme Court in hundredsof cases during his 4-year tenure. He was not merely another
                    appellatejudge, but a judge who in at least 416 total cases was neveronce reversed on appeal.
                    Moreover, the Supreme Court six timesadopted his dissenting opinion when he had the courage to
                    dissentfrom the majority of his judicial colleagues.Now, this is a jurist who, in the words of
                    President Carter's legalcounsel, Lloyd Cutler, will be counted by history as belongingalongside a
                    few select justices, like Oliver Wendell Holmes, LouisBrandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Potter
                    Stewart—whose wife is withyou here today and whom I have a great deal of admiration andrespect for,
                    of course, her husband—and Lewis Powell, as well.You have been paid an even higher tribute than even
                    that endorsement,however, Judge Bork. That tribute is found in the witnesslist of those who have
                    volunteered to testify in your behalf,and I will just mention a few. That list includes, as we have
                    seen, aformer President, a former Chief Justice, six former Attorney Generalsof both parties, twelve
                    top leaders of law enforcement officers,seven law school deans, twelve leading law professors in
                    this coun36try, four top anti-trust lawyers, three bar leaders, several of yourformer colleagues at
                    the Department of Justice, and other influentiallawyers and organizational heads. If an individual
                    can bejudged by the company he keeps, then you are unrivaled.In light of these remarkable
                    credentials, it is hard to understandwhy your nomination would generate controversy. The answer
                    isfound in one word, which is tragic in this judicial context, and thatword is "politics." Judge
                    Bork is experiencing the kind of innuendoand intrigue that usually accompanies a campaign for the
                    U.S.Senate. Many Senators are experienced at running that kind ofcampaign but it has no place in a
                    judicial nominating proceeding.Federal judges are not politicians and ought not to be judged
                    likepoliticians.The great danger I see in the impending ideological inquisition isinjury to the
                    independence and integrity of the Supreme Court andthe whole federal judiciary. When we undertake to
                    judge a judgeaccording to political rather than legal criteria, we have strippedthe judicial office
                    of all that makes it a distinct separated power. Ifthe general public begins to measure judges by a
                    political yardstickand if the judges themselves begin to base their decisions on politicalcriteria,
                    we will have lost the reasoning processes of the lawwhich have served us so well to check political
                    excesses and fervorover the past 200 years. I would ask any American if they wouldwish to have their
                    life, liberty and property resting on the decisionsof judges who are more worried about what the
                    newspapermight say about the case than they are about life, liberty or property.Recognizing
                    precisely this danger, the Senate has refused toemploy political litmus tests while confirming 53
                    justices over thispast century. Senate precedent does not support subjecting judicialnominees to
                    ideological inquisitions.Moreover, the Constitution itself does not support that practice.Based on
                    the common sense observation that a diverse congressionalbody would have difficulty overcoming
                    jealousies and politics toselect the best candidate, the framers in 1878—200 years ago, just 2days
                    from now—unanimously voted to vest the nomination powerin the President. The Senate, however, was
                    given a checking function.In the words of Alexander Hamilton, the advice and consentfunction was to
                    prevent "nepotism" and "unfit characters." Theadvice and consent function is a checking function,
                    not a license toexert political influence on another branch, not a license to controlthe outcome of
                    future cases by overriding the President's prerogatives.Despite the lessons of Senate precedent and
                    the Constitution anddespite the political damage to the independence and integrity ofthe judiciary,
                    we are likely to witness a bruising political campaignbefore your nomination comes to a final vote
                    in the Senate. It isnot difficult to outline in advance the type of campaign it will be.In the first
                    place, you will be labelled. Even though politicallitmus tests do not work well with judges, you
                    will be branded anextreme conservative. Of course, this will require some explanationas to why you
                    voted with your Carter-appointed colleague, JudgeRuth Ginzburg—who is a great judge, by the way—in
                    90 percent ofthe cases in which you both sat, or with your Carter-appointed col37league, Judge Abner
                    Mikva, in 83 percent of the cases in which youboth sat.The next tactic will be to extract a few
                    quotes from 15-year-oldarticles while you were a law professor and ignore your judicial actions.For
                    example, we have already heard allegations that youmight allow censorship of free speech. In fact,
                    anyone who wants toknow your views on censorship would merely need to read yourLebron decision where
                    you held that the D.C. Metro authoritiesviolated Mr. Lebron's free speech rights by refusing to let
                    himhang a poster that was extremely critical of President Reagan. Infact, those posters are going up
                    today. You were even willing toallow the embarrassment of the President who appointed you touphold
                    his rights. In my mind, actions speak louder than words.Another tactic will be to selectively use
                    evidence. For instance,we have already seen criticism that your Dronenburg decisiondenied
                    homosexuals a special constitutional protection. The evidencethat these critics consistently ignore
                    is that the SupremeCourt reached precisely the same decision and the same result inthe Bowers v.
                    Hardwick case.Still another tactic, familiar to political campaigns is to accuseyou of ethical
                    violations. In that vein, we have heard too much recentlyabout the so-called Saturday Night
                    Massacre. In fact, thiswas one of your finest hours. You were not the cause of Watergatebut you were
                    part of the solution. As a precondition of carrying outthe President's order, you gained a
                    commitment that the investigationwould go forth without further interference. You had to makea
                    difficult decision on the spur of the moment. Even then you hadto be convinced by Attorney General
                    Richardson not to resign, butthe evidence that your decision was correct is history. Because
                    youpreserved the investigation, the President was later forced toresign and several others were
                    prosecuted. The performance thatyou gave, it seems to me, deserves commendation, not criticism.It
                    will not end there. Inconsistent charges will be hurled at you.For example, you will be called both
                    an 'extremist" and "the onevote likely to tip the balance." You cannot be both, unless thosemaking
                    the charges are actually saying that four other justices arealready "extremists." Frankly, it is
                    more likely that those makingthe charge are the extremists themselves because the four
                    otherjustices, includes one—Justice White—appointed by President JohnKennedy, and two—Scalia and
                    O'Connor—who were unanimouslyapproved by the Senate. Unless they are also extremists, I do notsee
                    how you can change anything there. Consistency, I think youcan conclude, will not be a hallmark of
                    this debate.We could discuss likely political tactics for a long time. The importantthing to
                    remember is that these political charges betraythemselves. As Hodding Carter, an official from the
                    previous Democraticadministration, candidly observed, quote: "The nomination ofJudge Bork forces
                    liberals like me to confront a reality we don'twant to confront, which is that we are depending in
                    large part onthe least democratic institution, with a small "d", in government todefend what it is
                    we no longer are able to win out there in the electorate,"unquote.That is really what is involved
                    here, and I think he was candidand honest enough to state it in those succinct, candid terms.This is
                    the reason that politics are injected into this proceeding,because many politicians are hoping to
                    win from unelected judgeswhat they cannot win in the Congress or with the people of theUnited States
                    of America. My fear, however, is that the price of apoliticized judiciary is too high to pay in
                    exchange for a short-termpolicy set of gains. If judges fear to uphold the Constitution due
                    topolitical pressures or sense that their judicial careers might be advancedby reading that document
                    in the smokey back rooms of politicalintrigue, then the Constitution will no longer be the
                    solidanchor holding our nation in place during the times of storm andcrisis. Instead, the
                    Constitution will just become part of that politicalstorm, blowing hot and cold whenever the wind
                    changes. Thatis a price that we in this country cannot afford to pay, and I thinkit is important
                    that the American people understand that here.I commend you for subjecting yourself to this
                    situation and Icommend you for the work that you have done and for the respectthat you have from
                    people who are truly learned in the law allover this country and who set aside political gain.Thank
                    you for being here and thanks for accepting this nomination.</p>

                <strong>Howard M. Metzenbaum</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, I am happy to join my colleaguesin welcoming you this morning.My
                    vote, Judge Bork, on this nomination will be one of the mostimportant I cast as a U.S. Senator. The
                    passions generated by thisnomination on both sides reflect the enormous significance it hasfor every
                    American, yes for our children, for our grandchildren,and maybe even our great grandchildren.One of
                    the threshold questions we face in this confirmation processis the respective roles of the President
                    and the Senate. PresidentReagan and his Attorney General have made it a major priorityto change
                    basic constitutional principles. The President has proposeda series of constitutional amendments,
                    none of which hasmade any progress toward enactment. His Attorney General hasattempted to persuade
                    the Supreme Court to reinterpret the Bill ofRights. Fortunately, he too has been unsuccessful.Now it
                    is clear that the President wants to revise the Constitutionthrough his appointments to the Supreme
                    Court. No onewould question the President's right to attempt to amend the Constitution,but in the
                    Senate we have every right—yes, we have aduty—to challenge his attempt to amend it by the back door.
                    If thePresident attempts to change constitutional interpretation throughappointments to the Supreme
                    Court, the Senate cannot stand byand passively acquiesce.As the distinguished ranking member of this
                    committee, SenatorThurmond, and the President's Chief of Staff, Howard Baker, haveboth said, the
                    Senate has a constitutional obligation to consider theviews of a nominee. This is especially our
                    obligation when thePresident has selected a nominee by reason of those views.Moreover,the
                    confirmation of this nominee is likely to tip the Courtradically on key constitutional
                    issues.Justice Powell was a conservative justice who followed a pragmaticand careful approach. His
                    mind was not closed. He had greatrespect for precedent. He did not have a rigid view of the
                    boundariesof constitutional protections. Upon his retirement he said: "Inever think of myself as
                    having a judicial philosophy. I try to becareful to do justice to the particular case rather than
                    try to writeprinciples."Those who know Robert Bork know he is not Lewis Powell, nor Isuspect, would
                    he claim to be. Judge Bork categorically rejects anyconstitutional right of privacy. He believes the
                    Government has theright to regulate the family life and the sex life of every American.He believes
                    the Government can make it a crime for marriedadults to use birth control. He has an extremely
                    narrow view offree speech. He does not believe the equal protection clause appliesto women. He
                    opposes the constitutional principle of one-man, onevote.He would have upheld a poll tax on the
                    constitutional right tovote. He would have upheld a law allowing the forced sterilizationof
                    convicts.Judge Bork criticizes judges who make law, yet in interpretingcertain statutes, he appears
                    eager to do just that. He would radical45ly reinterpret the anti-trust laws in disregard of the
                    intent of Congresswhich he considers—that being the Congress, quote, "institutionallyincapable of
                    fashioning a rational anti-trust policy," end ofquote.He would allow giant companies to merge until
                    only two or threewere left. He would eliminate the right of retailers to give consumersa discount on
                    the products they buy. He would ignore Congress'concern about preserving small and independent
                    businesses.Judge Bork says he is neutral and even-handed in applying thelaw. Yet, in split decisions
                    involving disputes between the Governmentand an individual, he has voted for the Government
                    almost100 percent of the time. When citizens have wanted access to thecourts, he has always voted
                    against them. Yet, when a business ischallenging a regulatory agency of the Government, he has
                    beenon the corporate side in virtually every case.Another issue is Judge Bork's role in the Saturday
                    Night Massacre.A federal court found that his firing of Archibald Cox on PresidentNixon's orders was
                    illegal, a ruse—in the court's words—toget around the law. Now new information has come to light
                    whichsuggests Judge Bork may not have been completely forthcoming regardinghis role in this affair.
                    It is important to explore these matters,for what message does it convey if the Senate confirms to
                    thehighest court of the land someone who has violated the law.Finally, where does the nominee really
                    stand on the vital issuesthat he would face on the Supreme Court. A recent article statedthat Judge
                    Bork would now have us believe that his controversialwritings were the product of inexperience and
                    youth, when hetended to go, quote, "wild with ideas," end of quote. In fact, JudgeBork was 36 when
                    he wrote that requiring public establishments toserve blacks is a matter of "unsurpassed ugliness."
                    He was 44when he wrote that the first amendment does not protect scientificor literary speech. And
                    he was 60 when he reiterated just a fewmonths ago his view that the Constitution does not protect
                    our privacy.I strongly encourage you, Judge Bork, to be straightforward andclear with this
                    committee. The record is voluminous. It would be adisservice to you and the country to distort it.
                    These considerationslead me to be very troubled by this nomination. Judge Bork couldweaken,
                    literally within a few years, fundamental constitutionalfreedoms which the Supreme Court has
                    protected throughout itshistory.The Senate's inquiry follows more than just a consideration ofJudge
                    Bork's professional credentials.In the end each Senator justsearch his or conscience and ask, is the
                    confirmation of RobertBork in the best interest of this country.</p>

                    STATEMENT OF SENATOR ALAN K. SIMPSONHere we go again. We shall all be witness toone of the peculiar
                    things we see often in this great city. What wenow do is hereby targeted as "high drama," "the most
                    critical issueof the day," a "watershed," the "greatest test of the Presidency." Itis called the 4-H
                    Club of hype, hoorah, hysteria and hubris.I have served on this committee since I came to the U.S.
                    Senate.I chaired such a committee when I was in the Wyoming Legislature.It is a rich honor and
                    privilege to do so. It is this kind of acommittee that I enjoy. I enjoy my colleagues. It has been a
                    tremendousprivilege. It always commands my utmost respect, admiration,and also, my energies.I have
                    served under the chairmanship of Ted Kennedy. I havealways been treated exceedingly fairly and most
                    courteously byhim as chairman, and I have greatly enjoyed working with him onillegal immigration and
                    some other tough issues.I have served under Strom Thurmond, one of the most extraordinaryand deeply
                    respected Members of the Senate, a courtly, sincereand dedicated man. He has been of great help to
                    me and assistedin enabling me to grow and learn in many ways.Now I serve under the able chairmanship
                    of Joe Biden. I havecome to enjoy him very much. He is good to deal with, a spiritedman of great
                    energies and zest and enthusiasms, and he too hasbeen most generous to me.Over the course of those
                    years I have voted for judges presentedby Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, some of them absolutely
                    outstanding.Some seemed to me to be steady and thoughtful, of whateverparty, and they have proven to
                    be so. I think of Ab Mikva andPat Wald in the other party, superb judges. And there have beensome
                    real duds from both sides of the aisle—just like in Congress.I have learned much from this
                    committee, from these fine memberson both sides of the aisle, but the single most remarkablelesson
                    learned, and yet probably the most disappointing revelationto the layman, would be that I have found
                    that you either pass orkill a bill in the U.S. Congress by the use of a deft blend of emotion,fear,
                    guilt or racism.We now debate the confirmation or rejection of Robert Bork withthe use of the same
                    deft blend of emotion, fear, guilt or racism. TheAmerican people deserve a lot better than that.
                    That is really toobad. That ought not to be so. Go scratch through the records. Youwill find that I
                    have never objected to a nominee of either party onthe basis of ideological grounds alone, not one.I
                    am certainly not saying this nominee should be somehowspared ideological litmus tests of both sides.
                    That will be. No complaints.Ideology is a fair game, but surely not the acid test.I do not agree
                    with this nominee on several positions. Abortionmay be one. He is here to explain in full his
                    judicial position onthat. I think he already has, if you read it honestly. As a personalmatter I
                    happen to feel that this deeply intimate and awesomehuman decision should be a woman's choice.
                    Hopefully, it can bemade with the concurrence of the spouse, if one, and pastoral counselorsor
                    physicians, but it should be her choice. Judge Bork's personalviews on this issue are not our
                    concern. Too bad that has tonow be the litmus test here.Twice, you passed the confirmation of the
                    U.S. Senate. Twice,unanimously. Twice. I hope people remember that. They must havenew ground rules
                    now over at the American Bar Association. I paidmy dues there for 18 years. They unanimously
                    designated you asbeing, quote, "exceptionally well qualified" in 1981, the highestrating they can
                    give. Obviously, they are a rather forgetful lot overthere. I think, at one time or another, every
                    single member of thiscommittee has either toasted the ABA to the high heavens ortrashed them
                    royally, depending on just how they rated one oftheir particular favorite nominees.Now you are going
                    to have to pass some other tests. You used togive them; now you are going to pass them—tests about
                    abortion,affirmative action, civil rights, rights of privacy, homosexuality,contraception. I have
                    not heard it said yet, but there is the Griswoldcase that they speak of here with great passion—you
                    describedas "nutty." I think it was nutty, too.So maybe we will get to the truth somewhere in all of
                    this stuff.Obviously, we are going to be picking at a lot of old scabs. Too bad.Who among us here on
                    this panel—we in the U.S. Senate—are designatedas the "official score keepers" of our fellow humans?
                    Whodoes or does not judge, when we put aside the mistakes, the utterances,the errors of our earlier
                    lives, and who in this room has notfelt the rush of embarrassment or pain or a feeling of plain
                    stupidityabout a phrase previously uttered or an act long ago committed?Who of us here can pass that
                    test, and who then are the judges ofthat? Who appointed them?Three present sitting members of the
                    U.S. Senate voted againstthe Civil Rights Bill of 1964—three of our colleagues, along withBill
                    Fulbright, Senators Ervin, Smathers, the vice presidential candidateof the United States, Sparkman
                    and Senators Long and Russell.Are these then lessor people than us? Are they less respected?Are they
                    held up to a certain ridicule or to some different test? Ofcourse not. How absurd. All Bork did was
                    write about it. Theyvoted about it.Since this man's name was proposed by the President, the
                    variousinterest groups have been salivating at the chops, and I notethey have been thoroughly
                    engrossed in an exercise that must bethe epitome of effort for a lawyer—pouring over non-unanimous
                    decisions.What an exercise. Send them out to practice law for a fewdays to represent some woman who
                    says she is going to have anabortion or commit suicide, or wants to get some dude out of herhair
                    that is chopping her to pieces, or represent a client that is in aprobate contest before the body
                    has even cooled, or defend somecowboy who chewed another guy's ear off. Send them out into reallife.
                    Get them out from under their green eyeshades downtown andlet them do a little work. I referred to
                    them once as "bug-eyed zealots."I have no reason to change that opinion at all.Is this man wholly
                    "outside the mainstream" of Americanthought and judicial theory in America? I will not go any
                    further.There is the witness list. What an extraordinary witness list. Supportfrom a President of
                    the United States to the presidential"Counsel Emeritus" of all, Lloyd Cutler, and everyone in
                    between,including our remarkable former Chief Justice Warren Burger andBill Ruckelshaus, and a panel
                    of attorneys general—an extraordinaryarray of people.I have always felt that everyone is entitled to
                    their own opinion,but nobody is entitled to their own facts. You have been on thebench. The Senate
                    put you on the bench. The sitting members ofthis committee put you on the bench unanimously. And
                    SolicitorGeneral, unanimously. Each and every one of us. And what haveyou done since? That should be
                    an issue before us.You have written 102 opinions and none of them have been overruled.I will not go
                    into that. Your six dissents. I will not go intothat. But I think it is important to notice that
                    Judge Lewis Powell,the "swing-vote," quote, that you replace, on the cases where hewas voting on
                    your decisions agreed with you in 9 out of 10 of thosedecisions. Let's not miss that. Do not let
                    that go off the wall or skipoff the puddle.You have, indeed, voted with Ab Mikva 82 percent of the
                    time, orhe with you. And Pat Wald, 76 percent, Harry Edwards, 80 percent,Skelley Wright, 75 percent.
                    You must be doing somethingright.Well, I surely hope we do not spend an inordinate amount oftime on
                    words uttered and printed in 1971 or 1963, or articles writtenin 1979, or speeches made in 1954 or
                    1964 or 1974, or mistakesmade or opinions revised or arguments lost and found, unless wewould all
                    want to go through that particular test. And as the batteryof attorneys who have worked up a sweat
                    on this one seem tobe gaining all of their material from non-unanimous decisions, Ithink they really
                    are going to do nothing more in the long run butto be seen as replacing what was originally an
                    intense hostilitytoward your positions with what may prove to be a trivialization oftheir own
                    position—instead of a strengthening of it. I think we aregoing to watch that happen. I want to be
                    here. I think it will.There are not many of us here that would like to be at thattable, I can tell
                    you. I always get a kick out of the argument,"yeah, but we do not have to do that, we are United
                    States Senators.We do not have to pass that kind of test. The voters do thatfor us. This man is
                    going to the Court."I would sure hate to have someone rifling through the collectedutterances and
                    scratchings of Al Simpson. Lord, I did things andwrote things and said things—I did all sorts of
                    things when I was20 and 30 and 40 and 50 that I am not very proud of, and eventoday at this
                    magnificent and mature age of 56 I still cross the fineline between good humor and "smart aleck."
                    And when I do, I usuallyget hammered and I think I usually deserve it.So here we have before us a
                    man who the American public isgoing to get to know and see, and I think, understand in full
                    context.You will be subjected to some of the toughest and the easiest,the most appropriate and the
                    most inappropriate, and the mostthoughtful and the most unthoughtful, and the most inordinateand
                    inane questioning known to man—some of it laced with cynicismand sarcasm. But you will be ready for
                    that. I really thinkyou will.After all, it was you yourself who said, in the Oilman case,
                    quote:"Those who step into the areas of public dispute, who choose thepleasures and distractions of
                    controversy, must be willing to bearcriticism, disparagement and even wounding assessments,"
                    unquote.I have a hunch you like to mix it up, and there are some panelistshere that just love to do
                    that—me too—and you are going toget an awfully fine opportunity. My hunch is you are going toacquit
                    yourself very well. My stronger hunch is that you will makea very fine addition to the U.S. Supreme
                    Court. There, now, I toohave made a judgment before the hearings are concluded. A confessionis
                    made.But the people who know you best—those at the bench and thebar and in academe and those in
                    Congress who passed upon youtwice—after thorough investigations—will share that view. So oursis the
                    task of advice and consent. Would you be wise, even-handed,fair, responsible, and an intelligent
                    associate justice? Do you meetthat test? That is what we are here for. That is what we should behere
                    for.The test is not whether the nominee meets the approval of everysingle special interest group who
                    just happens to have a Washingtonoffice or a hyperactive executive director. That is not the test.Or
                    worse, a group that has been running a little low on funds sincethe last guy they strung on the
                    gallows was carried out feet first.And there are a lot of them running around in this village.I hope
                    we do not do what we did the last time with Justice Rehnquist.It seems to be an unpleasant reality
                    that a Supreme Courtnominee has every single constitutional protection until he or shewalks into
                    this room. And once in this room, unlike a defendant ina court of law, the nominee is not guaranteed
                    any single rightanalogous to the Miranda rule or the fifth amendment or anythingelse. They are often
                    meat for every form of accusation, innuendoand irrelevant and immaterial statement. It is that part
                    of theprocess that disturbs me greatly and which I believe is unseemlyand the dark side of our
                    deliberations.So I hope there will be restraint. I think there will be. We haveour work to do. We
                    must be about that in reviewing the work productof this man, Mr. Chairman, and doing so exceedingly
                    carefullyand not being delayed by aimless and remarkable volleys fired inorder to "get that guy—get
                    that man." We need not sully andtrash the highest standards of the United States Senate and
                    thiscommittee in our work.I intend to participate, Mr. Chairman, to listen, to hear, to try
                    tounderstand better, to try to understand the questioners, the opponents,the detractors. Will it be
                    that we will get to where the scrivenerswill eventually write, that the researchers will have
                    finishedpiling distinction upon distinction in non-uniform and non-unanimousdecisions and gathered
                    excised words and phrases to makeyou look like a boob or a madman? Or will we settle in and get
                    tothe know the essence of Robert Bork—human being, lawyer, jurist,author, debater, professor,
                    nominee for the highest court in theland? I hope that is what we will do, and I hope to help assure
                    it.Finally, I conclude—and I thank the chairman for his courtesy—it seems to me in my extensive
                    readings, and I really have donesome about you, that you have grown and learned and listened
                    andprobed and debated and argued and challenged and have been involvedin that life long adventure of
                    what I call "creeping maturity."That is a lot better than being lumped together with that
                    greatlegion of those of humankind known as the "dead un-killed."I await your presentation with great
                    anticipation. The chairmanand all members of the committee will assure that you will betreated most
                    fairly and courteously. That is the way he does it. Sowelcome to you and to Mary Ellen and your
                    family. I can assureyou that this will be absolutely the most stimulating class you haveever been
                    in.Thank you very much.</p>

                <strong>Dennis DeConcini</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, thank you.Judge Bork, I am not here to get you or to hurt you
                    or to embarrassyou and my questions during this effort here are going to be afar cry from what
                    Senator Simpson seems to depict may happen toyou, at least from this Senator.For the third time in
                    my short career in the Senate I am joiningother members to do what I think is probably the second
                    most importantobligation we have as Senators. I guess, with the exceptionto the power to declare
                    war, this is a responsibility that, to me,rests with us in the Constitution on the highest basis.It
                    is fitting that the Judiciary Committee begins the confirmationsof you, Judge Bork, during the week
                    that we are celebratingour 200th anniversary. That is a great day that is upon us thisweek, as a
                    matter of fact. My father was a lawyer and a SupremeCourt Judge in Arizona. I have been involved and
                    interested in theConstitution most of my life. And having served on the BicentennialCommission with
                    other members of this committee, I havegained a new respect and awareness of what our Founding
                    Fathershad, at least as I see.The authors of the Constitution were worried that one branch
                    ofgovernment over time could dominate another. To prevent such imbalancefrom occurring, they crafted
                    a delicate system of checksand balances among the three branches. It is as a part of that
                    delicatesystem signed 200 years ago this Thursday that we gatherhere today to implement.Because the
                    Constitution contemplated that the three branchesof government be equal, the selection of a Supreme
                    Court Justice isjust as important as the election of a new President or a new Congress.As a matter
                    of fact, the nomination and confirmation of aSupreme Court Justice is a pivotal point of our system
                    of checksand balances. That is why we are all here today.The founders did leave one important
                    decision about the adviceand consent procedures for us to decide after the Constitution wasin place.
                    What was left unanswered in 1787 was simply this—whatwere the criteria by which the decision of
                    nomination and confirmationshould be made? Much controversy about these criteria hasexisted over the
                    years and that controversy remains as great todayas I believe it ever was.Some supporters of you,
                    Judge Bork, argue that the Senateshould not consider your philosophy and ideology but should
                    decideonly whether you have the appropriate intellect, temperament andintegrity. Some of your
                    opponents, on the other hand, argue thatnot only may the Senate consider philosophy and ideology, we
                    mustbase our decision on the effects the nomination will have on futuredecisions; every future
                    decision of the Supreme Court.There is no immutable standard contained in the Constitution orany
                    other law for Senators to look to when they are facing the responsibilitybefore us today. Neither
                    approach described above inmy opinion is right or wrong. The Framers of the Constitution leftthe
                    decision to each individual Senator based on his or her ownconscience and sense of responsibility.I
                    will base my decision on you, Judge Bork, on your ability andexperience, your temperament, your
                    integrity, and whether or notI believe you will decide the cases before you based on the
                    Constitution,the statutes before you, the regulations, and to some extent,the traditional
                    interpretations of those items.I would be opposed to any nominee whose intentions are toignore the
                    precedents of the Court and lead it in a radically newdirection. I must be satisfied that in the
                    guise of what you representand Attorney General Meese called "judicial restraint," thatyou, Judge
                    Bork, are not a conservative judicial activist bent on imposingyour own political philosophy on the
                    Court and on thisnation.It is obvious, Judge Bork, that you have an extreme intellect.Your
                    experience as a lawyer, as Solicitor General, as a law professor,and as a circuit court judge is
                    very impressive to anyone. Ihave been told by many mutual friends that you enjoy a wit and asense of
                    humor, a congeniality with your other colleagues. Fromwhat I have read about you, Judge Bork, I
                    believe I would bepleased personally with your views on the criminal justice system,the right of the
                    government to prosecute criminals swiftly, firmlyand finally.The question is not whether I agree
                    with you, Judge Bork, moreoften than I disagree. I will not prepare a score card of your
                    decisionsand vote according to the previous hit and misses that youand I make. If I were to do this,
                    I might find the score in yourfavor. But this is not a game. There is no next day for the loser
                    inthe Supreme Court.The question that I will ask myself at the end of these confirmationshearings is
                    whether I am comfortable with the approach thatyou take in applying the Constitution and federal
                    laws to the factspresented to you. Do I believe that faced with the difficult decisions,with wide
                    ranging implications, that you, Judge Bork, willlisten carefully to the arguments on both sides and
                    then apply theappropriate law in an objective and unbiased way? Or will you findan intellectually
                    supportable and highly articulated way to decidethe case as you see fit and how you feel it should
                    come out?In my opinion, we have had too many result-oriented SupremeCourt Justices. I spent the last
                    several weeks reading many of youropinions, your law review articles and speeches. I have read
                    commentsand analyses by experts and commentators on both sides ofthis issue. In addition, I have
                    talked to literally thousands of peoplein Arizona and outside my State.I have identified the areas
                    that concern me and I will not reviewthose now at this time but ask that they be included in my
                    fullstatement, but I will go into some detail.The ultimate question that I must decide is whether I
                    feel secureputting our individual liberties, freedoms and the future of ourcountry in your hands.
                    History will tell us if a Justice confirmed bythe Senate is truly what our Founding Fathers had in
                    mind whenthey created our system of checks and balances. I intend to do all Ican to determine if
                    you, Judge Bork, measure up to that highstandard established by the Founding Fathers.Thank you, and
                    thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, I would like to first add my welcome,
                    before I start,to you and your family as you appear before this committee. Iknow you, too, are eager
                    to use your appearance as a way to addressthe many questions raised about your nomination. Of
                    course,I am eager to hear your views as well.It is often said—and I think correctly so—that one of
                    the Senate'smost important functions is that of reviewing the President'snominations to the Supreme
                    Court.Sadly, I believe this important function has been demeaned.Your nomination has been turned
                    into a real life and death battleamong the direct mail "giants" of American lobbying. The
                    intenselobbying has transformed this nomination into the legislativeequivalent of a pork barrel
                    water project—all strong-armed politics* * * no substance!The partisans who act as the "generals" in
                    this "war" of mudslinging have had some success. In fact, some members of theSenate have outflanked
                    each other for the honor of taking the mostextreme position, even before the first day of the
                    hearings!I think such positions are as intemperate as they are premature.It puts the judgment ahead
                    of the inquiry—precisely the kind ofclosed-mindedness that some accuse this nominee of having.
                    Theseremarks are mindful of the famous passage from "Alice in Wonderland,"where the Queen of Hearts
                    says to Alice, "Sentence first,verdict afterwards!"I am just one of 100 Senators. But I am here to
                    say at the outsetof these hearings that I have found much of the furor of the past 2months
                    deplorable.I will bet this intellectually empty debate over a Supreme Courtnominee would come as a
                    big surprise to at least one of our Constitution'sfounders—Alexander Hamilton. Hamilton was, of
                    course,the first to articulate the vital power of judicial review, in FederalistNo. 78. At the same
                    time, however, he recognized that the judicialbranch was to be the weakest of the three Departments.
                    In hiswords, the judiciary was supposed to have neither force nor will,only judgment.The framers,
                    such as Hamilton, expected that choices amongcompeting social values would be made by the people's
                    elected representatives—not by the unelected judiciary.Perhaps this furor during the summer of 1987
                    only confirms howfar the judiciary has drifted from its original purpose of 1787.It is no
                    exaggeration to say—especially in this the bicentennial ofour Constitution—that the existence of
                    constitutional governmentin America hinges on the capacity and the willingness of the SupremeCourt
                    to interpret the Constitution consistent with its trueintent. Accordingly, it is our awesome
                    responsibility to ensure, asbest we can, that a President's nominee to the Supreme Court
                    possessesthis capacity and willingness.Beyond the mere resume of this nominee, outstanding as it
                    maybe, he is not qualified to serve as a Justice in my view unless he iswilling to exercise
                    self-restraint—self-restraint which enables himto accept the Constitution as his rule of
                    decision—self-restraintwhich makes him resist the temptation to revise or amend thatdocument
                    according to his personal views of what is good publicpolicy.Former Chief Justice Stone identified
                    this duty of the Courtwhen he remarked in U.S. v. Butler in 1936, and I quote: "* * *While the
                    unconstitutional exercise of power by the executive andlegislative branches of Government is subject
                    to judicial restraint,the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense
                    ofself-restraint."Judges have no license to toy with the Constitution as if it weretheir personal
                    plaything, rather than the precious heritage of allAmericans.As Justice Frankfurter wrote in his
                    majority opinion in Ullmanv. U.S., and I quote: "Nothing new can be put into the Constitutionexcept
                    through the amendatory process. Nothing old can be takenout without that same
                    process."Unfortunately, a new generation of judges seems to have forgottenthat they are appointed,
                    not anointed. These judges—includingsome who have served on the Supreme Court—have demonstratedan
                    impatience with the democratic processes upon which ournation was founded and on which it has
                    flourished. Instead, theywould abuse the power of judicial review to impose their own viewof wise
                    public policy. They would prefer to act as scientists who usesome kind of "judicial alchemy" to
                    transform the words of the Constitutioninto meanings contrary to its plain reading or intent.I am
                    unalterably opposed to this kind of judicial arrogation oflegislative and executive function.I
                    believe that judges must give full effect to values that may befairly discovered in the text,
                    language and history of the Constitutionand apply them to modern conditions. But unelected and
                    unaccountablejudges should not freely overturn the legitimate policychoices of the equal, elected
                    branches, solely because of personalpreference. That is why the Founding Fathers, such as
                    AlexanderHamilton, referred to the judiciary as the "least dangerous"branch. And that is what
                    judicial restraint is all about.The nominee before us today has weighed-in many times againstthe
                    kind of judicial activism that tends to create rights not grantedin the Constitution or the
                    statutes. Frankly, his view that judgesought to confine themselves to interpreting the law, rather
                    thanadvocating their own ideas of "wise" public policy, is very appealingto me.I am anxious to hear
                    more of these views, to see if they follow inthe tradition of restraint practiced by Frankfurter,
                    Holmes, Brandeis,Stewart, Powell and a few others.Along the way, I expect that opponents of this
                    nominee willlikely focus on specific views or decisions that they disagree with. Iurge my colleagues
                    to keep their eyes on what I believe to be thereal issue in this confirmation debate. The real issue
                    is the extentto which judges should respect the decision-making of the electedrepresentative
                    branches of government.Make no mistake about it; the critics of this nominee know thelaw they prefer
                    is judge-made, and therefore susceptible to changeby other judges. Their loud protests underscore
                    that the law theyprefer is not found in the Constitution or the statutes.If their views were found
                    in the democratically-enacted law, theywould have no fear of any new judge pledged to live by the
                    credo ofjudicial restraint. Instead, these critics prefer judges who will actas some kind of "super
                    legislature"—who will give them victoriesin the courts when they lose in the legislature.Judge Bork,
                    I look forward to learning more about you from yourown words in the next few days.Having identified
                    my standard of review for this nomination, Iwould like to use my remaining time to add my thoughts
                    to a muchdebated point—the Senate's proper "advise and consent" role forthis
                    nomination.Traditionally, the Senate's role has been a very limited one. TheSenate has not made a
                    nominee's political philosophy the test forconfirmation.For example, it is universally acknowledged
                    that judicial nomineesshould not be asked to commit themselves on particularpoints of law in order
                    to satisfy a Senator's politics.I can illustrate the Senate's usual advise and consent standardwith
                    some passages from the nomination hearing of Justice O'Connor.As our now Chairman Senator Biden
                    said, and I quote: "We arenot attempting to determine whether or not the nominee agreeswith all of
                    us on each and every pressing social or legal issue of theday. Indeed, if that were the test, no one
                    could be passed by thiscommittee, much less the full Senate."Or as Senator Kennedy stated at that
                    same time, and I quote: "Itis offensive to suggest that a potential justice of the Supreme Courtmust
                    pass some presumed test of judicial philosophy. It is evenmore offensive to suggest that a potential
                    justice must pass thelitmus test of any single issue interest group."Or Senator Metzenbaum, who at
                    the same time said, and I quote:"I come to this hearing with no preconceived notions. If I happento
                    disagree with you on any specific issues, it will in no way affectmy judgment of your abilities to
                    serve on the Court."I might add that I very much agree with every one of my colleaguesin these
                    statements on the Senate's role. Each of theseviews carefully recognizes that the power to give
                    advice is not thepower to decide the issue. From George Washington to RonaldReagan, the President
                    has enjoyed a range of discretion in nominatingSupreme Court judges. Since 1894, the Senate has
                    deferredto the President's choice in all but four cases.The Senate should refuse its consent only
                    when the President'sdiscretion has been abused. Giving the Senate the last word, withoutsuch
                    deference, would mean the Senate has the only word. Thisconstitutional power the framers did not
                    give to us.Of course, in the absence of constitutional power, raw politicalpower can fill the
                    vacuum. I will stipulate right now to the abilityof a handful of my colleagues to block this
                    nomination; but I believeit would be the wrong way to approach this serious Senateduty.The dangers
                    of politicizing the nomination process are exceededonly by its short-sightedness. After all,
                    Presidential elections—andSupreme Court nominations—come and go.I urge my colleagues to resist the
                    clarion call of raw politics thatundermines the independent judiciary contemplated by Article IIIof
                    the Constitution.In closing, if my colleagues cannot resist the use of bald politicalpower, I would
                    at least hope that they have the courage to shed the"fig leaf behind which they hide their real
                    agenda.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                <strong>Patrick J. Leahy</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted tohave the admonition. I am also
                    pleased to welcome you, JudgeBork, to the Judiciary Committee this morning and your family.We
                    arrived in the U.S. Senate today at a moment that is reallyunique in our system of government. Two
                    hundred years ago thisweek, the delegates to the Constitutional Convention completedtheir work with
                    a fantastic document that has helped this countryflourish for 200 years since.I think not the least
                    of their achievement was the method establishedfor choosing the leaders of the judicial branch of
                    government.The authors of our Constitution recognized that this decisionwas far too important to
                    leave to the unfettered discretion of eitherof the other two branches. They said it had to be shared
                    by them.So our proceeding this morning, or this noon, really, joins the interestof all three
                    branches of the national government in oneplace.The goal of the process we begin today is the
                    conveyance of theguardianship of the Constitution. It is a solemn moment, but it isalso a moment
                    that teaches much about the system of governmentestablished in Philadelphia two centuries ago.I
                    suppose this confirmation hearing is going to have some aspectsreminiscent of both a trial by ordeal
                    or even a graduate seminar onconstitutional law. But it is not going to be either. It is going to
                    bean opportunity for Americans in the bicentennial year of the Constitutionto see the Constitution
                    in action. I hope Americans aregoing to be proud of what they see.The confirmation proceeding
                    formally begins today, but it hasreally been under way for weeks. In fact, one prominent feature
                    ofthat process so far has been an interesting debate on the role of theSenate in carrying out its
                    constitutional duty to aclvise and consent.The focus has been on the role that the nominee's
                    judicialphilosophy should play in the Senate's consideration of this nomination.I believe that
                    judicial philosophy should play a central role.Judge Bork, you and I have already discussed that
                    matter. Afterall, as the final arbiter of what the Constitution means, the SupremeCourt is the
                    ultimate guardian of the liberties of everyAmerican. There is no question that the nominee who is
                    confirmedto succeed Justice Lewis Powell is going to be uniquely influentialin determining the
                    direction of the Supreme Court's interpretationof the Constitution for many years to come. There can
                    hardly be anissue closer to the heart of the Senate's role than a full and publicexposition of the
                    nominee's approach to the Constitution and to therole of the courts in discerning and enforcing its
                    commands. Thatis my definition of judicial philosophy.Because I believe that judicial philosophy is
                    so important, I havedevoted an awful lot of beautiful summer days up in Vermont inan effort to learn
                    and understand the judicial philosophy of RobertBork. In fact, everywhere I went in Vermont
                    throughout themonth of August, I had people come up to me and speak either foror against this
                    nomination. In fact, I heard more about this issuethan any issue in the 13 years that I have been in
                    the U.S. Senate.In fact, Judge Bork, during the few days that you and your wife gota chance to also
                    be in Vermont, you probably heard a little bitabout it, too.I do not claim to understand Judge
                    Bork's judicial philosophycompletely. But having spent time immersed in his writing, hisspeeches,
                    his articles, his judicial decisions, his interviews, hisother works has told me a lot about the
                    nominee's conception ofthe Constitution and what it will mean for the Supreme Court andfor our
                    nation if Judge Bork is confirmed.Now, he has sharply criticized some of the views of what he
                    describesas the "intellectual class," but even though he has donethat, it is clear to me that Robert
                    Bork is an intellectual, of thefirst order. He is a thinker; he is a philosopher. And he comesbefore
                    this committee with a more comprehensive and clearly expressedjudicial philosophy than any nominee
                    to the SupremeCourt in recent history. That becomes really the good news and thebad news, depending
                    upon which side somebody might fall on thisnomination.America's Supreme Court Justices have taken
                    many paths to thehigh bench in that beautiful building that is just a block from here.For the most
                    part, the Justices have ascended to that bench as theculmination of careers as practicing lawyers,
                    or as jurists, or ashigh ranking government officials. But Judge Bork has been allthree of these
                    things at one time or another. If he is confirmed tothe Supreme Court, he also comes as a
                    distinguished legal philosopheras well.But his philosophy is distinguished in another way besides
                    itscomprehensiveness and clarity. It stands apart as a record of consistentand forceful opposition
                    to the mainstream of modern constitutionaljurisprudence. I doubt that any other nominee to the
                    SupremeCourt has ever come before this committee with a record ofsuch unremitting and relentless
                    opposition to the directions thatthe Court has taken on such a wide range of issues that touch onthe
                    basic freedoms of the American people.In article after article, in speech after speech, Judge Bork
                    hascriticized the constitutional decisions of the Supreme Court—notonce, not a few times, not a
                    dozen, but in scores of decisions. Hehas called these decisions "unprincipled," "intellectually
                    empty,"and even "unconstitutional." His targets have included the Court'smajor decisions in areas as
                    important as free speech, the right ofprivacy and equal protection of the laws.Now, in the writings
                    I have read, Judge Bork denounces thesedecisions emphatically, definitively, and very often
                    eloquently. Butthe elegance of his presentation should not obscure a central fact.He believes that
                    the Supreme Court has taken the wrong path.More precisely, he believes that the Court has wandered
                    off thepath into a trackless wilderness, far from the signposts erected inour written Constitution.
                    In fact, he has been consistent and clearand eloquent, and I think that that consistency has also
                    attractedhim to the President and the Attorney General in this nomination.But I am troubled by the
                    record of Judge Bork's philosophy as Iunderstand it today. I am struck by the breadth of his
                    opposition toestablished precedent, ranging from broad constitutional matters tonarrower questions
                    of the antitrust laws and other statutes. I amdisturbed by some of the interpretations that he
                    proposes for themajestic but general phrases of our Constitution: "freedom ofspeech," "liberty," and
                    "equal protection of the laws." And I amconcerned about the consequences of his philosophy.The
                    decisions of the Supreme Court shape in large part the contoursof our freedoms. Even the familiar
                    contours of freedoms longestablished in the Court's precedents can be changed as the powerto shape
                    them changes hands. And so we must be concerned aboutthe shape our freedoms will take if the Senate
                    agrees to give thisnominee, whose judicial philosophy is so critical of so many precedents—a pivotal
                    portion of the power to overturn them.But I am also aware that the perspective I have gained so far
                    onJudge Bork.Times change andso sometimes do the beliefs of men and woman who live throughthose
                    years.I hope that through these hearings we can learn more aboutJudge Bork's judicial philosophy.I
                    know his views on some issueshave changed over the years. I will be interested to learn whetherand
                    how his views on some of these fundamental constitutionalquestions have been refined or modified or
                    even abandoned. I lookforward to the testimony of the distinguished scholars and lawyersand other
                    witnesses before this committee who have studied thephilosophy far more extensively than I have. I
                    will be most interestedin Judge Bork's own testimony on these questions because hereally is the one
                    who can speak most eloquently, most completely,and, I believe, most honestly to his own philosophy
                    and his ownidea of the role of a Supreme Court Justice.We welcome you to the hearing. If you do not
                    know exactly whatto expect from the confirmation process, well, you are not totallyalone. There are
                    some things we can say with certainty about thisproceeding. It is going to be long; it will be
                    thorough; it will be informative;and I know I voice the sentiments of every member ofthis committee
                    when I say it will be fair. We really want it to be.Speaking as one Senator, I can tell you that it
                    will be approachedwith a seriousness and a thoughtfulness that befits its status as oneof the most
                    important duties of a United States Senator.In closing, let me just say one other thing. We have ai.
                    awful lotof hearings up here, confirmation hearings. In the 13 years I havebeen here, there have
                    been hundreds of them. Everybody frommilitary officers to Cabinet members to Supreme Court
                    Justices.Almost 95 percent of the time, those confirmation hearings simplyprovide a record because
                    the person is confirmed either unanimouslyor overwhelmingly afterward. The confirmation hearing
                    fulfillsthe constitutional role, but it really does not change anybody'smind.In your case, it will.
                    I think this confirmation hearing will be oneof those rare instances, certainly in my lifetime,
                    where a confirmationhearing has determined whether a nominee will be confirmedor not. So I think
                    this hearing takes on a seriousness and importanceto you as an individual, but to the country even
                    more so thanvirtually any hearing in my lifetime, and certainly in the time thatI have been here in
                    the Senate.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, I join my colleagues in welcoming you
                    here. At theoutset, I compliment you for being available for discussions withJudiciary Committee
                    members in a somewhat different way thanprior occasions. As you know, there are informal sessions,
                    andwhen we met you were willing to discuss at some length your approachto constitutional law. One of
                    the threshold questions whichyou and I discussed was whether you thought it appropriate to dealwith
                    the question of judicial philosophy. At that time you said youdid, and we then had extensive
                    discussions on issue of judicial philosophy.And I believe that that is very helpful. It may be that
                    inyour own situation, having written as prolifically as you have, thatthere was so much fat in the
                    fire, so to speak, to be discussed. But Ithink that this confirmation hearing may set a
                    precedent.Some of us were concerned about the hearings last year involvingChief Justice Rehnquist
                    and Justice Scalia in terms of the inabilityto get to some of the issues. So I think that it is very
                    useful,both for your confirmation hearing and for the process generally.In my own mind, a good bit
                    of the issue turns on whether manyof your prior writings constitute professorial theorizing or
                    representestablished judicial positions that you would vote if you wereon the Supreme Court of the
                    United States. As I read your priorwritings, they are at sharp variance with Justices from
                    OliverWendell Holmes to William Rehnquist. They are in agreementwith many Justices, but as I see it,
                    there are significant variations:the equal protection clause, for example, where you have
                    writtenapplicable only to race and have stated in later speeches that it israce and perhaps ethnic
                    matters, which is at variance with whatthe Court has decided for more than a century, extending
                    equalprotection to aliens, to women and to indigents and to illegitimatesand to others. The issue of
                    due process is a very important issue.The one of freedom of speech in your writings is at variance
                    withthe Holmes standard for clear and present danger. Those are someof the issues which I believe
                    are important.I think that the matters which have been raised really in yourwritings span the
                    spectrum of constitutional issues, and I think itwould be useful to have extensive discussions as to
                    your view of theConstitution. For me, the test is whether you fit within the traditionof U.S.
                    constitutional jurisprudence.I come to these hearings with an open mind, and I am preparedto listen
                    to your views on these subjects and to make a decisionbased upon what I hear significantly in this
                    room. Your prior backgroundcannot be ruled out, and what I have read about you andwhat I know about
                    you and your opinions and your speeches andyour Law Review articles are, of course, important. But I
                    think thecentral issue is what you will testify in this proceeding.On the issues which I have raised
                    so far, my sense is that thePresident is entitled to appropriate deference in his selection of
                    aSupreme Court nominee. I will be interested in your view on thatphilosophical question as
                    well.There is another subject which may present a somewhat differentissue, and that turns on the
                    matter of the conflict between theexecutive and legislative branch, article I and article II of the
                    Constitution.There are many issues where the President and the Congressdiffer historically and
                    differ today; for example, on the WarPowers Act or, for example, on independent counsel or, for
                    example,on congressional oversight of covert action. There, you havewritten extensively, and there
                    is a question in my mind as towhether your own views would tip the scale in favor, inordinatelyin
                    favor of executive control.I am not sure, and I have seen no writings on this subject as towhether
                    the traditional deference which the Senate gives to the executiveappointing power would be
                    applicable in that range becausethe Court, of course, is article III of the Constitution. That isa
                    subject which is of real concern to me, one that I thought aboutand one that I will seek your
                    opinion about.The writings which you have undertaken have been extensive.One of the professors has
                    criticized you for campaigning for the SupremeCourt, going from podium to podium, making speeches.
                    Itmay be that in this group that is quite a commendation. That iswhat we do all the time, go from
                    podium to podium, and I franklyfind no problem with that. The real issue is one of interpretation
                    ofthe Constitution and where you stand.The comments which you have made have been colorful. Therehas
                    been a certain quality of toughness, perhaps a biting quality,and I think we will be interested in
                    some of those matters in termsof your approach, some acerbity in some of the things which youhave
                    had to say about the Court. One of the comments which Ifound particularly intriguing was one of your
                    references—this is anold law journal article, but I think they are relevant to talk about.I do not
                    weigh them too heavily, but I think they are relevant—where you referred to the Supreme Court's
                    "institutionalized roleas perpetrator of limited coups d'etats." And you suggested thatthe Court was
                    no more "legitimate than any other institution," so"if the Court will not listen, why not argue the
                    case to some othergroup, say the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a body with a rather bettermeans for
                    implementing its decisions." An interesting approach.It may be that so much of what is in your
                    writing is hyperboleand something that a Justice or a professor would have to writeabout to attract
                    attention. We know in the Senate people thinkthat we have great platforms, but very frequently we
                    think nobodylistens to us, and probably they should not listen to most of whatwe have to say. So
                    perhaps what you have written which appearsto be at variance with established constitutional
                    doctrine is suchhyperbole.Those, for me, are the issues which are presented here and thematters
                    which I will focus on when my turns comes to question onthe key factors upon which I will make my
                    decision.I yield back the balance of my time.</p>

                <strong>Howell T. Heflin</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, often in these hallowed halls, wesay that we are engaged in an
                    historic process. Such statements,sincerely made, are sometimes true. Seldom, however, do we stopto
                    think of the significance of those statements. I would propose wedo so today.Today, we are
                    participating in a process to determine the fitnessof the nominee to become an Associate Justice of
                    the highest Courtof our land.This process, historic as it is, has meaning for men and women10 years
                    from now, 20 years from now, and even into the next century,for judicial opinions have real
                    consequences for real people.Judicial confirmations, likewise, have real consequences for themen and
                    women of America.Even though the proceedings of the Supreme Court are not televised,the Supreme
                    Court is really "The People's Court." While itdeals, on one level, with abstract legal
                    propositions—standing, ripeness,due process and the like—the Court at heart deals withpeople, their
                    rights, their liberties, their property, their disputesand grievances and their means of redress and
                    resolution. There isnot a single case which comes to the Court which, in some manner,does not
                    involve or affect people.My point is a simple one, and it is one that underscores the importanceof
                    the position, Judge Bork, to which you have been nominated.Judicial opinions rendered in real cases
                    and controversiesinvolve real people and have actual consequences:They determine where and with whom
                    people may live, and thelegal limits of permissible activity in which people may engage;They
                    determine where and with whom children may go to school,what textbooks they may use, and what, if
                    any, prayers they maypray;They determine the rights of people to be secure in their homes,properties
                    and thoroughfares, the rights of all people to enjoy thefruits of their toil and the pursuits after
                    happiness;They determine the rights of victims and the rights of the accused;They determine delicate
                    questions of personal privacy;They also determine what books we may read, what movies wemay see, and
                    by result though not intent, what stories the pressmay cover and how they may cover them.These
                    hearings, then, are about justice, about the rights of individualsand the rights of society as a
                    whole. In essence, equalityunder the law. The question, then, for us is whether the ends ofjustice
                    will be further served, or disserved, by our vote for oragainst confirmation.Let us be
                    intellectually honest with ourselves and with theAmerican people. Let us put out on the table, get
                    out in the open,those things we hear, those allegations made in the media and inthe letters,
                    telegrams and the phone calls we receive. Let us air allof the arguments, pro and con, about this
                    nominee.We are told by some that Judge Bork is a brilliant man, an eruditescholar whose credentials,
                    experience and fundamental integrityare beyond question.We are told by others that Judge Bork is
                    intolerant and that hewill personally be responsible for the courts rolling back the clockon
                    advances in the areas of individual rights, racial progress andpersonal privacy.We are told by some
                    that Judge Bork will strictly construe theConstitution, eschewing activism and interpreting the law,
                    not substitutinghis personal opinion for what the law should be.We are told by others that Judge
                    Bork is an extremist, an ideologueof the first order, a legal zealot who will use his position onthe
                    Court to advance a far right radical judicial agenda.We are told that President Reagan is entitled
                    to have his nomineesconfirmed unless they are incompetent or dishonest.We are told by others,
                    however, that President Reagan made hischoice on the basis of ideology, which some contend is an
                    impermissiblecriterion. Still others say if ideology is a permissible criterionfor the President,
                    then it is a permissible factor for the Senate toconsider in evaluating this nomination.To all of
                    Judge Bork's sponsors and supporters, I say come forward.Let us have the evidence about competence,
                    tolerance andfairness.To all Judge Bork's critics and detractors, I likewise say comeforward. Let us
                    have the evidence of incompetence, intolerance andunfairness.While the hearing process should be
                    comprehensive and complete,there is, nevertheless, one area of inquiry which should beapproached
                    with caution; that is in the area of the nominee's religiousbeliefs.There are those who charge that
                    Judge Bork is an agnostic or anon-believer. These critics contend that such beliefs will affect
                    theopinions of the courts and, hence, our churches, our synagogues,and, ultimately, our lives. While
                    voicing concern about the proprietyof a religious test, some critics contend, nevertheless, that
                    this isa legitimate area of inquiry, for in determining the fitness of anominee, they argue, one
                    must look to the total man—his reasoningprocess and the reaches of his values and views.However, let
                    me remind my colleagues that clause (3) of articleVI of the Constitution of the United States
                    clearly provides that"no religious test shall be required as a qualification to any officeor public
                    trust under the United States."This clause, as well as the spirit of the freedom of religion
                    clausein the first amendment, should be carefully observed in pursuingany inquiry, whether it be
                    legitimate or not, as to one's personalreligious feelings.I can say with great conviction three
                    things: Judicial activism ofthe right is to be dreaded, surely as much as activism of the
                    left;Violence to the principle of stare decisis in a results-orientedrush to a predetermined outcome
                    is to be feared, surely as much asviolence in the streets;An ideological predisposition, or, worse,
                    commitment to roll backthe clock on individual equality and personal liberties is abhorrentto our
                    now fundamental precepts of a fair and just society.Judge Bork, if the committee is convinced that
                    you will balancesociety's need for law and order with individual rights and personalfreedoms; that
                    your jurisprudence is deferential to electedbodies; and that you do not have a proclivity for
                    activism, thenyour confirmation chances are enhanced.However, if the evidence shows that you are
                    intelligent but anideologue—a zealot—that you are principled but prejudiced, thatyou are competent
                    but closed-minded, then there is considerabledoubt as to whether you will be confirmed by the
                    Senate.Having said all these things, we do not at this stage know whatthe evidence will adduce.
                    Therefore, to all of my colleagues, and toour respective constituents, I say let us not prejudge.
                    Let us hearthe evidence, analyze it, weigh it. I have spoken of feared anddreaded judicial maladies,
                    but the worst judicial or legislative diseaseis a closed mind.In determining the fitness of this
                    nominee, let no mind be closedby either blind party allegiance or rigid ideological adherence. Letno
                    Senator approach these hearings with anything less than anawesome sense of responsibility to do what
                    is right in his or herown mind. We each must follow the mandates of our conscience.A vote to confirm
                    or not to confirm this nominee is more thanjust a vote. It is a reaffirmation of our commitment to
                    the Constitution,to equality, to a stable democratic society, to liberty, to justice.Let the hearing
                    process begin. Let the record be made. Let fairnessprevail. Let justice be done.Thank you, Mr.
                    Chairman.</p>

                <strong>Gordon J. Humphrey</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Before leaving New Hampshire last night, I was
                    interviewed by atelevision reporter on the Bork nomination, and the reporter askedme a number of
                    questions. One of those questions, notwithstandingthe seriousness of these hearings, made me laugh.
                    It was this ques*tion:"Senator, has the Bork nomination gotten wrapped up in politics?"Boy, has it
                    ever. I have been around this city for 9 years, andthe charges against Judge Bork are the worst
                    infestation of politicsthis Senator has ever seen.How else can you explain the fact that 5 years ago
                    the U.S.Senate unanimously confirmed Robert Bork, this very man, to thesecond most important court
                    in the nation; and now in 1987, 5years later, some Senators are acting like they have amnesia
                    abouttheir own voting records. So it is either amnesia, it seems to me, orit is politics. It has got
                    to be one or the other.Then there are some special interest groups with their loathingfor a man who
                    believes in judicial restraint fearful of a judge whobelieves controversial questions ought to be
                    left to democraticallyelected legislatures except where there is a violation of clear meaningof the
                    Constitution. To listen to some of these groups, you getthe impression that Judge Bork is an
                    extremist, a racist, a sexist;indeed, an archenemy of the Constitution.The funny thing about this
                    alleged extremist. He's a judge. Thisfellow Bork is already a federal judge, a high judge, a judge
                    on theCircuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Most experts—and there are certainly a
                    lot of them when it comes to thelaw—most experts regard that court as the second most importantin
                    the nation, second only to the Supreme Court in its importance.This fellow Bork, this embodiment of
                    evil—if you believe some ofhis critics—is a very high judge. And guess who confirmed himjudge to the
                    second most important court in the country? TheSenate of the United States, that is who. We did it.
                    We madeRobert Bork a judge 5 years ago by a unanimous vote; not a negativevote among them.So the
                    question I have is this: If Robert Bork is the archenemy ofthe Constitution, alleged by his critics,
                    if he is an extremist, aracist, a sexist, then where in the world were all of the U.S. Senatorswho
                    voted to confirm him 5 years ago to the D.C. Circuit Courtof Appeals? Were they asleep? Were they
                    hallucinating? Were theynot paying attention? Were they irresponsible? Didn't they care?Or are they
                    just a bunch of racists and extremists themselves?I say to those who have raised vicious charges
                    against JudgeBork, come off it, come off it. You insult not only Judge Bork butthe U.S. Senate as
                    well. We do not in this body confirm ogres andmisfits to the Federal bench.Now, about the nominee.
                    The first thing I want to point out isthat Robert Bork does not need to take all this guff, and we
                    oughtto be mighty grateful to him and to his family for their willingnessto submit themselves to the
                    guttersnipe gang who have had suchplay in recent weeks. Here is a man who is brilliant. He
                    attendedthe University of Chicago Law School, elected Phi Beta Kappa. Hecould be earning a million
                    bucks a year easily. He had it made. Hewas in with a prestigious law firm, and then he threw it all
                    overboardto go off to Yale Law School and teach law. Professors do notmake that much money, but he
                    saw it as a higher calling.Even after 11 years of teaching, he took time out for yet an evenhigher
                    calling, serving as Solicitor General of the United States,the third highest office in the Justice
                    Department. He served exceedinglywell there under exceedingly trying circumstances. Thenback to Yale
                    Law School for another 4 years, and then he was nominatedand confirmed—unanimously by the U.S.
                    Senate, let us remember—to the second most important court in the country, theCircuit Court of
                    Appeals for the District of Columbia.There he has compiled the most remarkable and exemplaryrecord.
                    Robert Bork has served his country well: two stints in theU.S. Marine Corps to serving as a high
                    official in the Justice Department,to Federal Appeals Court judge. Robert Bork has servedthis nation
                    well, and we ought to be glad that he is willing todevote his mind and his strength to teaching and
                    to governmentservices, because with his brilliance and his credentials, he couldhave been a
                    multimillionaire by now.The question before us is simple: Is the nominee qualified toserve on the
                    Supreme Court? If we were looking for the ideal nominee,we would look for someone who graduated from
                    a prestigiouslaw school with high grades, as did Robert Bork. We would look forsomeone who taught
                    law at a prestigious university, as did RobertBork. We would look for someone who served on a
                    circuit court ofappeals, preferably the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia,as has Robert
                    Bork.If you were looking for the ideal nominee, you would look for anexperienced judge who had
                    earned accolades from highly respectauthorities, as has Judge Bork. Accolades from whom? How abouta
                    retired Supreme Court Justice, Chief Justice Warren Burger, whorecently said—and it bears repeating;
                    I know others have referredto this, including I think President Ford, but it bears repeating.Warren
                    Burger said, "I do not think in more than 50 years since Iwas in law school there has ever been a
                    nomination of a man orwoman any better qualified than Judge Bork," and that languageincludes Warren
                    Burger, does it not? I think that is pretty remarkable.Savor that accolade for a moment. The best
                    qualified nomineein 50 years. That speaks a lot louder to this Senator than anydozen noisy special
                    interest groups clamoring for Robert Bork'sscalp.Justice Burger has no axes to grind; neither does
                    Justice JohnPaul Stevens, still serving on the Supreme Court, who said, "I personallyregard Judge
                    Bork as a very well-qualified candidate andone who will be a very welcome addition to the
                    Court."Bork is very well qualified, according to Justice Stevens, andthese are impressive, very
                    impressive accolades to this Senator—unless we are prepared to dismiss Justices Burger and Stevens
                    asextremists, too. Burger and Stevens are not alone in their highpraise. Former President Gerald
                    Ford was before us this morningon behalf of Robert Bork; eminent Democrats as well support
                    thisnominee, including two of the highest, most senior officials of theCarter administration in the
                    area of law: Lloyd Cutler, PresidentCarter's White House counsel, and former Attorney General
                    GriffinBell. And they will be here to testify on behalf of the nominee,as will five other Attorneys
                    General of the United States.So how has Bork earned the confidence of such highly
                    respectedauthorities? Performance, that is how. Bork's critics will focus onhis theoretical writings
                    from as long as 25 years ago, but the realmeasure of Bork as a judge—not Robert Bork as a college
                    professor,not Robert Bork as a provocative academician probing the establishment—but the real
                    measure of Robert Bork as judge is hisrecord on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. His record.Let us
                    look at the record. It is impeccable. The Senate actedwisely when it unanimously confirmed this man
                    to the bench in1982. So sound has been his reasoning, so carefully crafted havebeen his decisions
                    that not one opinion—not a one—has been overturnedby the Supreme Court. Robert Bork has written or
                    joined inover 400 such decisions since he joined the D.C. Circuit Court, andnot once has a decision
                    been overturned by the Supreme Court onappeal. That is very impressive to this Senator. Now, we know
                    whyso many eminent authorities have such high praise for this judge.Why, then, the inquisition? Why
                    the scurrilous charges againstthe man whose fitness for the bench was carefully examined bythis body
                    before he was confirmed by a unanimous vote of theSenate 5 years ago? Why the salvos against a judge
                    who has compiledan impeccable record in his opinions?I think I know the answer. The most extreme
                    opposition to JudgeBork comes from those who consider the Supreme Court, as constitutedin recent
                    times, a convenient place to sidestep the democraticprocess. A judge like Robert Bork, who not only
                    preaches the doctrineof judicial restraint but practices it as well, is a great inconvenienceto
                    those who do not trust the values of the Americanpeople. Judges like Robert Bork do not substitute
                    their personalviews for a neutral reading of the Constitution. Judges like RobertBork do not act
                    like legislators, creating new law. Instead, they actlike judges, scrupulously interpreting the
                    intent of the framers ofthe Constitution and of the democratically elected legislators herein
                    Congress and in the State legislatures.We legislators ought to be grateful for that. Judge Bork does
                    notwant to take over our turf, as do some of his brethren. I am grateful.Judge Bork believes, along
                    with many of both liberal and conservativepersuasion, along with many present and past, that ifnew
                    rights are to be created, they ought to be created by representativesof the people who are
                    democratically elected by the peopleand who are accountable to the people every 2 or 6 years as
                    thecase may be.Judges like Robert Bork believe that new rights ought not to becreated by judges who
                    are elected by absolutely no one and who, intheir appointments for life, are accountable to
                    absolutely no one. Isay long live the principle and the practice of judicial restraint.Is Robert
                    Bork with his judicial restraint out of the mainstream?Over the last 5 years, he has voted with the
                    majority in 94 percentof the cases in which he participated. Ninety-four percent soundspretty
                    mainstream to this Senator. Or on the other hand, perhapsthe D.C. Circuit Court is full of
                    extremists. That is not the answerat all because we know that among the members of that
                    distinguishedbody are many who are liberal and many who are conservative,and about an equal number
                    who are so-called moderates.The record shows that Judge Bork voted with the majority 94percent of
                    the time. That sounds mainstream to this Senator. RememberAntonin Scalia? We confirmed him last year
                    to the SupremeCourt by a unanimous vote. There were no charges of extremismagainst Scalia. So what?
                    Scalia and Bork served together fornearly 4 years on the same Court, and Bork voted with Scalia
                    98percent of the time in which they both participated in cases.Ninety-eight percent. Does that make
                    Scalia an extremist, too? Ofcourse not. It means instead that these charges against Bork
                    arepolitical poppycock, pure political poppycock, 99.9 percent pure, sopure it floats.We will have a
                    good review of Robert Bork's life in the next 2weeks. This is your life, Robert Bork. And even
                    though we havebeen through all of this before and found him fit, it will be thorough—as it should
                    be—but let us also make it thoroughly fair becauseit should be thoroughly fair as well.I finally
                    have to say this, that I think we have gotten off to a bitof a rocky start by delaying these
                    hearings a record 70 days and byintemperate remarks and irresponsible charges by a small numberof
                    members on this panel.</p>

                <strong>Paul Simon</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, we welcome you and your family. It has
                    been said,accurately, that what we are about to decide is going to have agreat impact on this nation
                    well into the next century. I woulddiffer with my colleague, Senator Humphrey, on one point. I
                    didnot happen to be here when you were approved for the circuitcourt of appeals. I can very well
                    visualized voting for someone forthe circuit court of appeals, but not for the Supreme Court,
                    becausehere you are really setting the course for the nation.Over at that building not too many feet
                    from here are the fourwords "Equal Justice Under Law." I want them to be much morethan simply words
                    chiseled on stone. And I say this as a nonlawyermember of this panel. I want those words to live,
                    and Iwant the Supreme Court Justices to make them live.I know there are a few, very few, out there
                    who write to me orwho contact us and say let us just keep postponing so PresidentReagan cannot make
                    an appointment. President Reagan was elected.He is entitled to nominate whomever he wishes, and we
                    havethe equal responsibility of weighing that nomination. I expectPresident Reagan to nominate a
                    conservative.Justice Powell is aconservative. Six of the eight members of the Court sitting rightnow
                    have been appointed by Republican Presidents, the majorityapproved by Democratic members of the
                    Senate.I do not find the question quite as simple as some do. I thinkthere are several questions
                    that we have to ask ourselves and thatI will be asking myself during the course of your testimony.
                    First,is the nominee open-minded and fair? Your job is not simply torender justice, but also to
                    symbolize justice for the people of thisnation.I want to make sure that really takes place, both the
                    symbolicrole and the rendering of justice. I do not want someone with anideological mission of
                    either the right or the left.Second, I want a nominee who is sensitive to civil rights. I am 58years
                    old. I have seen huge progress made in this nation. Not thatwe do not have a long way to go yet, but
                    much of that progress hasbeen because of the Supreme Court, nine people who sit in thatbuilding over
                    there. I want someone who is willing to lead on civilrights, not simply someone who will be dragging
                    his feet.Third, I want someone sensitive to civil liberties. Freedom ismuch easier to give away than
                    to protect. I want someone who isgoing to preserve our freedom, who is willing to stand up, if
                    neces93sary, against public opinion. Public opinion sometimes can be dramaticallywrong. I think of
                    the decision in 1942 on the internmentof Japanese-Americans. The Supreme Court knuckled under
                    topublic opinion. I want someone who is going to protect the civil libertiesof Japanese-Americans,
                    of all Americans, whatever theirbackground.I want someone who is going to protect the people of this
                    nationagainst the abuse of power by government, and we know from experiencein our country and in
                    other countries that governmentcan abuse that power.I want someone who is sensitive to our
                    traditions of separation ofchurch and State. My father was a Lutheran minister. I have
                    anunderstanding of the yearnings that people have for values in oursociety, and I want to preserve
                    those values. But I also recognizethere are things that government can do well, like providing
                    studentaid. At the same time there are things that governmentcannot do well. One of things is to
                    promote religion. I want tomake sure the nominee is sensitive to our traditions.Then, finally, I
                    want someone who has some compassion. I do notexpect your heart to overrule your head, but there
                    will be marginalcases that a Supreme Court Justice will have to rule on. And Iwant a Supreme Court
                    Justice who cares about people, just as Iwant a government that cares about people.That sounds like
                    a tall order, those requirements, but I thinkthere are people, conservatives and liberals, Democrats
                    and Republicans,who meet that. I want the letter of the Constitution to befollowed, but I also want
                    the spirit of the Constitution to be followed.Dennis DeConcini, my colleague from Arizona, in his
                    remarksperhaps summarized it best. He said a few minute ago, "The ultimatequestion I must decide is
                    whether I feel secure putting ourindividual liberty, freedoms, and the future of our country in
                    hishands." That is an awesome responsibility on our part and on thepart of whoever goes to that
                    Court.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                <strong>Joe Biden Jr.</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you. You are duly sworn.Judge Bork, I would like to make an opening
                    statement if I may.OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR.I would like to welcome you
                    back this afternoon and personallywelcome you to the Senate Judiciary Committee. You have heardmuch
                    today—and we have all heard a great deal today—about thebicentennial of our Constitution. But as you
                    and I both know, theconvention in Philadelphia was only one very important chapter inthe history of
                    our people and in the evolution of our unique form ofgovernment.From that day in Philadelphia to
                    this hour, the heart of the controversyover the Constitution has been ever the basic questionthat is
                    certain to animate the debate that may commence in thiscommittee, and that is the debate about the
                    tensions between therights of an individual and the will of the majority.As James Madison, the
                    father of the Constitution said, and Iquote: "The great object of the Constitution is to secure the
                    publicgood and private right against the danger of the majority factionand at the same time to
                    preserve the spirit and the form of populargovernment," end of quote.Judge, the seasons have turned
                    to centuries and the documentwe now celebrate, the world's longest and oldest living
                    constitution,for over the past 200 years, is something that we will formally celebratetomorrow. And
                    for 200 years each generation of Americanshas been called to nurture, defend it, define it and apply
                    it.Senator Sam Ervin, our late colleague from North Carolina, wasfond of reminding all of us and
                    quoting an eloquent educator aboutthe ties between t}ie Magna Carta, the English Petition of
                    Rights,the Declaration of Independence, and the U.S. Constitution.The quote he used to always use
                    was this: "These are great documentsof history. Cut them and they will bleed, bleed with theblood of
                    those who fashioned them and those who nurtured themthrough the succeeding generations."Judge, each
                    generation in some sense has had as much to do toauthor our Constitution as the 39 men who affixed
                    their signaturesto it 200 years ago. Indeed, 2 years after its signing, following abitter national
                    debate over its ratification, at the insistence of thepeople, the Constitution was profoundly
                    ennobled by the additionof what has come to be known as the Bill of Rights.Before a hundred years
                    would transpire, a civil war erupted overthe meaning of that Constitution and that so-called bill of
                    rights, acivil war which would answer Lincoln's question whether, quote,"any nation so conceived and
                    so dedicated can long endure."From that civil war would emerge the so-called Civil WarAmendments
                    which would settle forever the truth that all men arecreated equal. It gave definition through those
                    Civil War Amendmentsto what many thought were meant in the first instance. Butbefore another 100
                    years would pass our own century would be distinguishedby hotly contested struggles to assimilate
                    into the veryfabric of the Constitution equal protection for blacks, minoritiesand women.As surely
                    as those who waged the Civil War, those who wagedthe struggle for civil rights infused the
                    Constitution with their ownvision. The story of these struggles at its heart, in my view, is
                    thestory of what makes America and her people the envy of the world.In each of these struggles which
                    I have made reference to, each ofthese struggles in each of these times when the individual faced
                    arecalcitrant government, the individual won his or her rights,always expanding; his or her rights
                    always expanding.America is the promised land because each generation bequeathedto their children a
                    promise, a promise that they mightnot come to enjoy but which they fully expected their offspring
                    tofulfill. So the words "all men are created equal" took a life of theirown, ultimately destined to
                    end slavery and enfranchise women.And the words, "equal protection and due process" inevitably ledto
                    the end of the words, "separate but equal," ensuring that thewalls of segregation would crumble,
                    whether at the lunch counteror in the voting booth.So, faithful to that tradition, in the ebbing
                    summer of our bicentennial,the Constitution must become more than an object of celebration.It is to
                    become once again the center of a critical nationaldebate over what it is, what it must become, and
                    how it will be appliedin a world that neither you nor I can envision at thismoment, a world of
                    biotechnical engineering, a world of burgeoningchanges in science, a world where once again the
                    rights of individualsand the right of the government to impact upon them will beput in a different
                    context and in conflict.So let's make no mistake about it, the unique importance of thisnomination
                    is in part because of the moment in history in which itcomes, for I believe that a greater question
                    transcends the issue ofthis nomination. And that question is, will we retreat from our traditionof
                    progress or will we move forward, continuing to expandand envelope the rights of individuals in a
                    changing world which isbound to have an impact upon those individuals' sense of who theyare and what
                    they can do, will these ennobling human rights andhuman dignity, which is a legacy of the past two
                    centuries, continueto mark the journey of our people?So Judge, as you well know, this is no ordinary
                    nomination, notmerely because you are there. And I must say to you that it mustbe somewhat daunting,
                    as experienced as you are, to sit there withan array of people here about to question you. It is not
                    an easy positionto be in. I am confident—and I am not being solicitous—youwill handle it well, but
                    nonetheless, it is not an easy position.But this nomination is more—with all due respect, Judge, and
                    Iam sure you would agree—than about you. In passing on this nominationto the Supreme Court, we must
                    also pass judgment onwhether or not your particular philosophy is an appropriate one atthis time in
                    our history.You are no ordinary nominee, Judge, to your great credit. Overmore than a quarter of a
                    century you have been recognized as aleading—perhaps the leading—proponent of a provocative
                    constitutionalphilosophy, one that when I was in law school—I did not goto Yale; I am not bragging
                    about that but I did not go to Yale—onewhere our constitutional law professor would say, "and this
                    is suchand such," and then, "as Professor Bork at Yale says."You have been a man of significant
                    standing in the academiccommunity and thus in a special way, a vote to confirm you requires,in my
                    view, an endorsement of your basic philosophic viewsas they relate to the Constitution. And thus the
                    Senate, in exercisingits constitutional role of advice and consent, has not only theright in my
                    opinion but the duty to weigh the philosophy of thenominee as it reaches its own independent
                    decision, a view that Ithink you share, but I will ask you about that in the question andanswer
                    period.Essentially, the role of this committee as I see it is to provide anopportunity for your
                    advocates and your adversaries, your opponents,the opponents of this nomination and the supporters
                    of thisnomination, to present their views for consideration as they cometo the witness table at
                    which you sit.But most of all, it is an important opportunity and it is a requiredopportunity—and I
                    and my colleagues assure you of the opportunity—to fully offer your views and for members to
                    questionyou on what you mean by the views that you hold.My role as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary
                    Committee in myview is not to persuade but to attempt to ensure that the criticalissues involved in
                    this nomination are laid squarely before my colleaguesand the American people.As I made clear when
                    Senator Baker contacted me and when AttorneyGeneral Meese came to see me prior to your selection, as
                    Itold them privately, Judge, that as a matter of principle I continuedto be deeply troubled by many
                    of the things you had written. Iwould have been less than honest then or now to pretend
                    otherwise.Judge, assuming you mean what you have written, our differencesare not personal, they
                    relate to basic questions of principle. Iwill question you in several areas to determine what our
                    differencesmean in terms of real cases with real people, with real winnersand real losers.For
                    example, my areas of concern touch the relationship ofpeople of different races in our land; whether
                    it was wrong forState courts to enforce covenants that prohibited black couplesfrom buying homes in
                    white neighborhoods; whether the court waswrong in not stopping the U.S. Congress from outlawing
                    literacytests to protect voting rights; and whether in the future as similarsituations arise the
                    Court will intervene to protect the rights of theraces in this land.I also touch on the basic right
                    of privacy, privacy in our marriagesand in raising our children; whether the government canprohibit
                    a child from going to a private school; whether the governmentcan prohibit parents from having their
                    children taught a foreignlanguage; whether anyone can be subjected to sterilization, beit the
                    government of Oklahoma attempting to forcibly sterilize athief or by a big business which forces a
                    woman to choose betweenher job and her right to bear children; or whether the governmentcan prohibit
                    a married couple from using birth control; or whetherin the future as populations grow and explode,
                    whether the governmentcan say, you may only have two children.I also touch on the right of free
                    expression, be it political—forexample, whether Martin Luther King could have been prohibitedfrom
                    advocating violation of immoral segregation laws—or be it artistic;for example, can an American be
                    denied the right to createand enjoy literature, painting, sculpture, dance, music, and moviesof
                    their choice.I not only think it was wrong for some of these things to havehappened in our
                    country—and they did—but it was also right forthe Supreme Court, in my view, to have stepped in in
                    many of thecases that I made reference to without naming them when it did toprotect these rights of
                    individuals against the majority.From much of what I have read—and I honestly believe, Judge, Ithink
                    I have read everything that you have written, and you havebeen very cooperative. We asked you to
                    provide it and you have literallyprovided us hundreds of pages of written material. Based onthat
                    material, we appear to disagree about whether the SupremeCourt was right or wrong in many of these
                    cases. While there isplenty of room for debate about these issues, each of us must takea stand on
                    whether or not we believe the Court was wrong in thesemost critical decisions of our time.I believe
                    all Americans are born with certain inalienable rights.As a child of God, I believe my rights are
                    not derived from the Constitution.My rights are not derived from any government. Myrights are not
                    denied from any majority. My rights are because Iexist. They were given to me and each of my fellow
                    citizens by ourcreator and they represent the essence of human dignity.I agree with Justice Harlan,
                    the most conservative jurist andJustice of our era, who stated that the Constitution is, quote,
                    "aliving thing" and that "its protections are enshrined in majesticphrases like 'equal protection
                    under the law 'and 'due process' andthus cannot be," as he said, and I quote, "reduced to any
                    formula,"end of quote.It is, as the great Chief Justice John Marshall said, and I quote,"intended to
                    endure for ages to come and consequently to be adoptedto the various crises of human affairs, only
                    its great outlinesmarked," end of quote.For the next 2 weeks or so, obviously only in your case, I
                    hope,Judge, for the next couple of days or so, my colleagues and I, yourselfand others, will be
                    engaged in a historic discussion that couldaffect the direction of our country. I think it would be
                    a disserviceto the American people if we allowed that day to be clouded bystrident rhetoric from the
                    far left or the far right.Such inflammatory statements only distract from the centralfocus of these
                    hearings. For better than two decades you have beena distinguished scholar, a man whose ideas have
                    been debated inmany constitutional law classes in this country. In your writingsyou have
                    forthrightly stated your principles. To use your ownwords in your published opening statement, which
                    you have notgiven yet: "My philosophy of judging is neither liberal nor conservative/When I have
                    been asked—as I have been after having read yourwritings this August—whether I thought you were a
                    conservativeor a liberal, my response was just as yours; I believe you are neithera conservative nor
                    a liberal. You have a very precise, as I readit, viewing of how to read the Constitution.You have
                    suggested equally forthrightly what we should examinein reviewing your nomination when you said, and
                    I am quotingyou: "You look for a track record, and that means you read anyarticle, any opinions they
                    have written. There is no reason to beupset about that," end of quote.I agree with you that there is
                    a consistent thread that runsthrough your writings. You said just 2 years ago that you,
                    quote,"finally worked out a philosophy which is expressed pretty muchin that 1971 Indiana Law
                    Journal piece," end of quote. And yourmost definitive writing to date has been, as I can read it,
                    thatpiece.Later you added, "my views have remained about what theywere."In the end, whatever my
                    reaction or anyone else's reaction toyour record, the process of confirmation is best served if we
                    heareach other out and use this unique opportunity to educate ourselvesand the American people about
                    your record and what it maymean for the Supreme Court and for the future of this country thatwe both
                    love very much.Out of respect for you, out of the majesty of the Constitution andthe greatness of
                    the American people it seems to me we who presidein this hearing today owe no less.Judge, I would
                    now invite you, if you would like, to make anyopening statement for as long as you would like and
                    then we willbegin with the questioning.I thank you for your indulgence this morning in listening to
                    allof us.OPENING STATEMENT OF ROBERT H. BORK, TO BE ASSOCIATEJUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">I want to begin by thanking the President for placingmy name in nomination
                    for this most important position. I amflattered and humbled to have been selected. If confirmed, I
                    assurethe Senate that I will approach the enormous task energeticallyand enthusiastically and will
                    endeavor to the best of my ability tolive up to the confidence placed in me.I also want to thank
                    President Ford and Senators Dole and Danforthand Congressman Fish for their warm remarks in
                    introducingme to the Senate and to this committee.As you have said, quite correctly, Mr. Chairman,
                    and as othershave said here today, this is in large measure a discussion of judicialphilosophy, and
                    I want to make a few remarks at the outset onthat subject of central interest.That is, my
                    understanding of how a judge should go about his orher work. That may also be described as my
                    philosophy of the roleof a judge in a constitutional democracy.The judge's authority derives
                    entirely from the fact that he is applyingthe law and not his personal values. That is why the
                    Americanpublic accepts the decisions of its courts, accepts even decisionsthat nullify the laws a
                    majority of the electorate or of their representativesvoted for.The judge, to deserve that trust and
                    that authority, must beevery bit as governed by law as is the Congress, the President, theState
                    Governors and legislatures, and the American people. Noone, including a judge, can be above the law.
                    Only in that way willjustice be done and the freedom of Americans assured.How should a judge go
                    about finding the law? The only legitimateway, in my opinion, is by attempting to discern what
                    thosewho made the law intended. The intentions of the lawmakersgovern whether the lawmakers are the
                    Congress of the UnitedStates enacting a statute or whether they are those who ratifiedour
                    Constitution and its various amendments.Where the words are precise and the facts simple, that is a
                    relativelyeasy task. Where the words are general, as is the case withsome of the most profound
                    protections of our liberties—in the Billof Rights and in the Civil War Amendments—the task is far
                    morecomplex. It is to find the principle or value that was intended to beprotected and to see that
                    it is protected.As I wrote in an opinion for our court, the judge's responsibility"is to discern how
                    the framers' values, defined in the context of theworld they knew, apply in the world we know."If a
                    judge abandons intention as his guide, there is no law availableto him and he begins to legislate a
                    social agenda for the Americanpeople. That goes well beyond his legitimate power.He or she then
                    diminishes liberty instead of enhancing it. That iswhy I agree with Judge Learned Hand, one of the
                    great jurists inour history, when he wrote that the judge's "authority and his immunitydepend upon
                    the assumption that he speaks with themouths of others: the momentum of his utterances must be
                    greaterthan any which his personal reputation and character can commandif it is to do the work
                    assigned to it—if it is to stand againstthe passionate resentments arising out of the interests he
                    mustfrustrate." To state that another way, the judge must speak withthe authority of the past and
                    yet accommodate that past to thepresent.The past, however, includes not only the intentions of those
                    whofirst made the law, it also includes those past judges who interpretedit and applied it in prior
                    cases. That is why a judge must havegreat respect for precedent. It is one thing as a legal theorist
                    tocriticize the reasoning of a prior decision, even to criticize it severely,as I have done. It is
                    another and more serious thing altogetherfor a judge to ignore or overturn a prior decision. That
                    requiresmuch careful thought.Times come, of course, when even a venerable precedent can andshould be
                    overruled. The primary example of a proper overruling isBrown v. Board of Education, the case which
                    outlawed racial segregationaccomplished by government action. Brown overturned therule of separate
                    but equal laid down 58 years before in Plessy v.Ferguson. Yet Brown, delivered with the authority of
                    a unanimousCourt, was clearly correct and represents perhaps the greatestmoral achievement of our
                    constitutional law.Nevertheless, overruling should be done sparingly and cautiously.Respect for
                    precedent is a part of the great tradition of our law,just as is fidelity to the intent of those who
                    ratified the Constitutionand enacted our statutes. That does not mean that constitutionallaw is
                    static. It will evolve as judges modify doctrine to meetnew circumstances and new technologies.
                    Thus, today we apply thefirst amendment's guarantee of the freedom of the press to radioand
                    television, and we apply to electronic surveillance the fourthamendment's guarantee of privacy for
                    the individual against unreasonablesearches of his or her home.I can put the matter no better than I
                    did in an opinion on mypresent court. Speaking of the judge's duty, I wrote: "The importantthing,
                    the ultimate consideration, is the constitutional freedomthat is given into our keeping. A judge who
                    refuses to see newthreats to an established constitutional value and hence provides acrabbed
                    interpretation that robs a provision of its full, fair and reasonablemeaning, fails in his judicial
                    duty. That duty, I repeat, is toensure that the powers and freedoms the framers specified aremade
                    effective in today's circumstances."But I should add to that passage that when a judge goes
                    beyondthis and reads entirely new values into the Constitution, values theframers and the ratifiers
                    did not put there, he deprives the peopleof their liberty. That liberty, which the Constitution
                    clearly envisions,is the liberty of the people to set their own social agendathrough the processes
                    of democracy.Conservative judges frustrated that process in the mid-1930's byusing the concept they
                    had invented, the 14th amendment's supposedguarantee of a liberty of contract, to strike down laws
                    designedto protect workers and labor unions. That was wrong thenand it would be wrong now.My
                    philosophy of judging, Mr. Chairman, as you pointed out, isneither liberal nor conservative. It is
                    simply a philosophy of judgingwhich gives the Constitution a full and fair interpretation but,where
                    the Constitution is silent, leaves the policy struggles to theCongress, the President, the
                    legislatures and executives of the 50States, and to the American people.I welcome this opportunity
                    to come before the committee andanswer whatever questions the members may have. I am quite willingto
                    discuss with you my judicial philosophy and the approach Itake to deciding cases. I cannot, of
                    course, commit myself as to howI might vote on any particular case and I know you would not wishme
                    to do that.I note in closing, though it has been mentioned by PresidentFord, that I have been
                    fortunate to have a rich variety of experiencein my professional career in the major areas of
                    private practice,the academic world, government experience, and the judiciary.I have been an
                    associate junior partner and senior partner in oneof the nation's major law firms. I have been a
                    professor at the YaleLaw School, holding two named chairs, as Chancellor Kent Professor,once held by
                    William Howard Taft, and as the first AlexanderM. Bickel Professor of Public Law.For almost 4 years
                    I served as Solicitor General of the UnitedStates, in which capacity I submitted hundreds of briefs
                    and personallyargued about 35 cases before the Supreme Court of theUnited States.Finally, for the
                    past 5Vfe years I have been a judge in the U.S.Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
                    Circuit, where I havewritten, according to my count—counts have varied here thismorning—about 150
                    opinions, and participated in over 400 decisions.I have a record in each of these areas of the law
                    and it is forthis committee and the Senate to judge that record.I will be happy to answer the
                    committee's questions.</p>

                    record in this round of questioningthat I have. I want to talk a little bit about what you have said
                    andwhat you believe about the role of the courts and what that role isin society, and as you said,
                    your judicial philosophy.Judge Bork, I am sure you know the one question to be raised inthese
                    hearings is whether or not you are going to vote to overturnSupreme Court decisions, which is
                    obviously your right as a SupremeCourt Justice, if you are confirmed.In 1981 in testimony before the
                    Congress, you said "there aredozens of cases" in which the Supreme Court made a wrong decision.This
                    January, in remarks before the Federalist Society, youimplied that you would have no problem in
                    overruling decisionsbased on a philosophy or a rationale that you rejected.In an interview with the
                    District Lawyer magazine in 1985, youwere asked if you could identify cases that you think should be
                    reconsidered.You said, and I again quote, "Yes, I can but I won't."Would you be willing for this
                    committee to identify the "dozensof cases" that you think should be reconsidered?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, to do that I am afraid I would haveto go out and start back
                    through the casebooks again to pick outthe ones.I do not know how many should be reconsidered. I can
                    discusswith you the grounds upon, the way in which I would reconsiderthem.Let me mention that
                    Federalist Society talk which was givenfrom scribbled notes. I had some notes, but I scribbled
                    something inthe margin which I got up and said in response to another speaker.It was that a
                    non-originalist decision—by which I mean a decisionwhich does not relate to a principle or value the
                    ratifiers enactedin the Constitution—could be overruled.If you look at the next paragraph of that
                    talk, which was a writtenout part and not the extemporized part, it contradicts thatstatement. The
                    very next paragraph states that the enormous expansionof the commerce power, Congress' power under
                    the commerceclause of the Constitution, is settled, and it is simply too lateto go back and
                    reconsider that, even though it appears to be muchbroader than anything the framers or the ratifiers
                    intended.So there is, in fact, a recognition on my part that stare decisis orthe theory of precedent
                    is important. In fact, I would say to youthat anybody who believes in original intention as the
                    means of interpretingthe Constitution has to have a theory of precedent, becausethis Nation has
                    grown in ways that do not comport with theintentions of the people who wrote the Constitution—the
                    commerceclause is one example—and it is simply too late to go back and tearthat up.I cite to you the
                    Legal Tender cases. These are extreme examplesadmittedly. Scholarship suggests that the framers
                    intended to prohibitpaper money. Any judge who today thought he would go backto the original intent
                    really ought to be accompanied by a guardianrather than be sitting on a bench.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">All right. I criticized these cases on the basis of thereasoning or lack of
                    reasoning that the courts offered. For example,the case that has come up and was mentioned, I think,
                    in youropening statement, Shelley v. Kraemer. Shelley v. Kraemer was acase decided under the 14th
                    amendment. The 14th amendment, aswe all know, applies only when government acts, when
                    governmentcoerces and denies equal protection of the laws or due process.That was a racial covenant,
                    restrictive racial covenant case, andthe Court held that when a State court enforced that contract,
                    thatwas action by the government; and, hence, the 14th amendment appliedto private action.I have
                    never been for racially restrictive covenants. I argued inthe Supreme Court that racially
                    discriminatory private contractswere covered by Section 1981, a famous post-Civil War enactment,and
                    outlawed as such by that statute. That was Runyon v.McCrary.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Oh, yes. But it just had not been applied. It was apost-Civil War
                    statute.The difficulty with Shelley was not that it struck down a racialcovenant, which I would be
                    delighted to see happen, but that itadopted a principle which, if generally adopted, would turn
                    almostall private action into action to be judged by the Constitution.Let me give you an example. If
                    people at a dinner party get intoa political argument, and the guest refuses to leave when asked
                    todo so by the host, and finally the host calls the police to have theunwanted guest ejected, under
                    Shelley v. Kraemer that wouldbecome State action, and the guest could raise the first amendment.His
                    first amendment rights would have been violated becausea private person got sick of his political
                    diatribe and askedhim to leave and the police assisted him.In that way, any contract action, any
                    tort action, any kind ofaction can be turned into a constitutional case. Now, I am notalone in
                    criticizing Shelley v. Kraemer. I think I have here ProfessorHerbert Wechsler who has criticized it.
                    Professor Tribe has saidthat, "[t]o contemporary commentators . . . Shelley and [anothercase] appear
                    as highly controversial decisions. In neither case, thecritical consensus has it, is the Court's
                    finding of State action [Governmentcoercion] supported by any reasoning which would suggestthat the
                    'State action' [doctrine] is a meaningful requirementrather than an empty formality."There have been
                    some suggestions that my constitutional philosophyor my reasoning about these cases is in some sense
                    eccentric.It is not in the least bit. All of these cases have been criticized. Infact, Shelley v.
                    Kraemer has never been applied again. It has hadno generative force. It has not proved to be a
                    precedent. As such, itis not a case to be reconsidered. It did what it did; it adopted aprinciple
                    which the Court has never adopted again. And while Icriticized the case at the time, it is not a
                    case worth reconsidering.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, let's talk about another case. Let's talkabout the Griswold case. Now,
                    while you were living in Connecticut,that State had a law—I know you know this, but for
                    therecord—that it made it a crime for anyone, even a married couple,to use birth control. You
                    indicated that you thought that law was"nutty," to use your words and I quite agree. Nevertheless,
                    Connecticut,under that "nutty" law, prosecuted and convicted a doctorand the case finally reached
                    the Supreme Court.The Court said that the law violated a married couple's constitutionalright to
                    privacy. You criticized this opinion in numerous articlesand speeches, beginning in 1971 and as
                    recently as July 26thof this year. In your 1971 article, "Neutral Principles and SomeFirst Amendment
                    Problems," you said that the right of marriedcouples to have sexual relations without fear of
                    unwanted childrenis no more worthy of constitutional protection by the courts thanthe right of
                    public utilities to be free of pollution control laws.You argued that the utility company's right or
                    gratification, Ithink you referred to it, to make money and the married couple'sright or
                    gratification to have sexual relations without fear of unwantedchildren, as "the cases are
                    identical." Now, I am trying tounderstand this. It appears to me that you are saying that the
                    governmenthas as much right to control a married couple's decisionabout choosing to have a child or
                    not, as that government has aright to control the public utility's right to pollute the air. Am
                    Imisstating your rationale here?</p>

                    the Constitution, the judge is enforcinghis own moral values, which I have objected to. Now, on

                    to be picky here. Clearly, I do not want toget into a debate with a professor, but it seems to me
                    that whatyou are saying is what I said and that is, that the Constitution—ifit were a constitutional
                    right, if the Constitution said anywhere init, in your view, that a married couple's right to engage
                    in the decisionof having a child or not having a child was a constitutionallyprotectedright of
                    privacy, then you would rule that that rightexists. You would not leave it to a legislative body no

                    It got up to the Supreme Courtunder the name of Poe v. Ullman. The Supreme Court refused totake the

                    you and it went like this. I happen toagree with it. It said, in part, "would we allow the police to
                    searchthe sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of contraceptives?The very idea is
                    repulsive to the notions of privacysurrounding the marriage relationship. We deal with the right
                    ofprivacy older than the Bill of Rights. Marriage is a coming togetherfor better or worse, hopefully
                    enduring, and intimate to thedegree of being sacred. The association promotes a way of life,
                    notcauses. A harmony of living, not political face. A bilateral loyalty,not a commercial or social
                    projects."Obviously, that Justice believes that the Constitution protectsmarried couples, anyone.

                    favor ofGriswold v. Connecticut. I thought that was a great way to reason.I tried to build a course
                    around that, only I said: we can call it ageneral right of freedom, and let's then take the various
                    provisionsof the Constitution, treat them the way a lawyer treats commonlaw cases, extract a more
                    general principle and apply that.I did that for about 6 or 7 years, and Bickel fought me every
                    stepof the way; said it was not possible. At the end of 6 or 7 years, Idecided he was right.</p>

                    right not to be sterilized by the government.The Supreme Court addressed that right in the famous
                    case,Skinner v. Oklahoma. Under Oklahoma law, someone convicted ofcertain crimes faced mandatory
                    sterilization. In 1942, Mr. Skinnerhad been convicted of his third offense and therefore, faced
                    sterilization,brought his case to the Supreme Court. The Court said thatthe State of Oklahoma could
                    not sterilize him. Let me read somethingfrom the Court's opinion."We are dealing with legislation
                    which involves one of the basiccivil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental tothe
                    very existence and survival of a race. There is no redemptionfor the individual whom the law
                    touches. Any experiment whichthe State conducts is to his irreparable injury. He is forever
                    deprivedof a basic liberty."Judge, you said that Supreme Court decision is improper and
                    intellectuallyempty. I would like to ask you, do you think that thereis a basic right, under the
                    Constitution, not to forcibly sterilized bythe State?</p>

                    procreationand fundamental rights to do it. That is, he noted that thestatute made distinctions, for
                    example, between a robber and anembezzler. The embezzler was not subject to this kind of thing.Had
                    he gone on and pointed out that those distinctions reallysterilized, in effect, blue collar

                    decidewhether a whole group was in or out and then they would decidewhat level of scrutiny they
                    would give to the statute to see whetherit was constitutional or not.I think that derives—and I hate
                    to get into a technical question—but I think it derives from a footnote in the Carolene
                    Productscase, in which they were supposed to look at groups, as such.It would be much better if
                    instead of taking groups as such andsaying this group is in, that group is out, if they merely used
                    a reasonablebasis test and asked whether the law had a reasonablebasis. I think the statute, in

                    If there is not one, you cannot. It seems tome that it comes down to a basic difference. You do not
                    believe theConstitution recognizes what I consider to be a basic liberty, a basicliberty not to be
                    sterilized.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I hope so.Judge, my time is about up, but with regard to the Griswoldcase,
                    you are quoted in 1985—you were a judge at this time, althoughthis statement was not made in your
                    judicial capacity—assaying, "I don't think there is a supportable method of constitutionalreasoning
                    underlying the Griswold decision."So obviously, you thought about it, and you at least at that
                    pointconcluded you could not find one.It seems to me, Judge—and as I said, there are many more
                    casesI would like to talk to you about, and I appreciate you engaging inthis dialogue—that you say
                    that a State can impact upon maritalrelations and can impact upon certain other relations, and it
                    seemsto me that there are certain basic rights that they cannot touch.And what you seem to be saying
                    to me is that a State legislaturecan theoretically, at least, pass a law sterilizing, and we will
                    seewhat the courts say. It is not an automatic, it is not basic. Rightnow, if any State legislature
                    in the country asked counsel for thelegislature, "Could we pass a law, sterilizing?" I suspect the
                    immediateresponse from counsel would be, "No, you cannot do that"—not only politically, but
                    constitutionally.Have any State legislative bodies said, "Can we decide on whetheror not someone can
                    or cannot use contraceptives," not any reasonablebasis, I imagine all counsel would say "No" flatly;
                    cannoteven get into that area.And it seems to me you are not saying that. You are saying thatit is
                    possible that can happen, and in Griswold you are saying thatthere is no principle upon which they
                    could reach the result—notthe rationale, you say; you say the result.</p>

                <strong>Robert C. Byrd</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, I thank you for allowing me to interveneat this point to make
                    my opening statement—or, to make astatement; this may be the opening and the closing statement.And I
                    thank Senator Thurmond and my other colleagues on thecommittee for allowing me to proceed.I join
                    with all of my colleagues in welcoming Judge Bork backbefore the Judiciary Committee and in
                    welcoming him to thesehearings; and I apologize for not being present to hear your openingstatement.
                    I assume you will be making further statements, soI can use the word "opening" advisedly.I
                    compliment you, Judge Bork, on this nomination, and I notonly wish to express a hearty welcome to
                    you, but also to yourlovely wife and your sons and daughter, who I am told are seatedhere in the
                    audience today.As I have stated so many times in the past, the Senate has boththe right and the duty
                    to scrutinize as carefully as possible the individualswho are nominated to serve on the Supreme
                    Court of theUnited States.Unlike the case when we consider legislation, the Senate has nosecond
                    chance in passing on lifetime appointments. As an equalpartner with the President in making these
                    appointments, theSenate should consider the nominee's integrity, candor, temperament,experience,
                    education, and judicial philosophy.So we meet here today to begin the exercise of that
                    responsibility.For my own part, I have certain questions, which I hope that if Iam not here to ask
                    them, that the committee will endeavor tosecure answers for them, and certainly to explore them. I
                    am interestedin your apparent belief in the concept of judicial restraint.Let me say also at this
                    early point in my statement that it doesnot bother me that you are a conservative. I am a
                    conservative. Everybodyknows that from the shirts that we are wearing today. Idid not wear a blue
                    shirt, nor did you, nor did I see Strom Thurmondnor Orrin Hatch. But not so facetiously, I am not
                    troubledthat you are a conservative. I am not even troubled that the nominationand confirmation of a
                    conservative to fill this position whichwill become vacant will tilt the Court in the direction of a
                    conservativeCourt.I think that the Supreme Court of the United States should be aconservative Court.
                    I think the Court should be conservative. Ihappen to believe that the body in our constitutional
                    system thatshould be liberal, if at all, is the legislative body, in which I serve.But I do not
                    construe the intent of the writers of our Constitution—I do not believe that they intended for the
                    Supreme Court ofthe United States to be a "travelling Constitutional Convention",as the late Mr.
                    Justice Hugo Black referred to at one point in astatement.I think that the legislature is here to
                    make the laws; that is whatthe founders said in the first sentence of the first article of
                    theConstitution of the United States. So I intend, as far as I am concerned,to not make my final
                    judgment, and it is not made if I hadto answer before God right at this moment, as to how I would
                    voteon your nomination; I could not say.The fact that you are a conservative does not bother me, and
                    itdoes not bother me if the Court becomes what is called a conservativecourt because I was very
                    critical of the court in earlier years.When Chief Justice Warren held that position, I was very
                    criticalof the Court.And this is one vote for or against you at some point, but I willjust say that
                    to make it very clear that I do not personally want tosee another Warren Court in my lifetime.But I
                    am interested in your apparent belief in the concept of judicialrestraint. You have used this term
                    in many instances, bothin your writings—which are very extensive—in your teachings, andin your
                    service as a Member of the U.S. District Court of Appealsof the District of Columbia.You have called
                    for judges to defer to the will of the people asexpressed through their elected representatives.
                    This makes goodsense.I shall ask a question which is a rhetorical question, but which Iam sure this
                    committee will explore and which I very much needthe answer to in making my own decision on your
                    nomination.Where in your embrace of majority rule is the protection for therights of the minority?
                    Now, as the majority leader of the Senateand one who has been the minority leader of the Senate, I
                    am veryconscious of the rights of the minority, and I chafe often because Ifeel that the rights of
                    the majority are being abused by the minority,and I feel that the majority should rule. But at the
                    same time, Ifeel that the minority has some rights, too, in the Senate of theUnited States.So I am
                    sure it can be appreciated that I would ask this question.We are both interested in majority rule,
                    but where do you embracein your concept of judicial restraint the rights of the minority?You have
                    written extensively as a legal theorist about deferenceto majority will. But are your views on
                    standing so restrictive thatthe little guy, or even the U.S. Senate, has no hope of ever gettinghis
                    or her or its day in court?I read a great deal about you, and as I have indicated, I have
                    atremendous amount of respect for you, and I admire you. I believethat the committee should explore
                    your beliefs, your philosophy, inseveral areas.As majority leader, my duties will often require my
                    presence onthe Senate floor, and I will not be able to attend these hearings asmuch as I would like
                    to attend them. I wish I could be here. I willread the record carefully, not just turn it over to a
                    staff memberbefore I reach my final decision on your nomination, and I will bewatching the tapes as
                    much as I can in the evenings so that I trulycan keep abreast as much as possible of these
                    hearings.I hope that the committee will be able to ask you and other witnessesto address these
                    concerns, some of which I am mentioninghere.First and perhaps most fundamentally, the committee
                    should inquireabout your understanding of and adherence to the principleof judicial restraint. It
                    has been argued that you apply this philosophyselectively. One report even suggests that it is
                    possible to determinethe outcome of your decisions depending on the parties toa case.Now, having
                    been in the political arena for 42 years, I know howcharges are made, and often made without
                    substantial good reason.But this is the purpose of these hearings, to determine in our ownviewpoints
                    and in answer to our own consciences, where do youstand. Is it true that you apply the philosophy of
                    judicial restraintselectively? And is it true that depending on whether or not theparticipants are
                    the government and a utility or some other business,that you will decide this way or that way;
                    depending uponwhether or not it is a government agency and an individual or apublic interest group,
                    you will decide this way or that way, and itcan almost be foretold before you speak as to where you
                    will comedown?I do not know. But I have read that, and I have read some casesthat would indicate
                    that at least there is some good reason to thinkthat.So I hope that the committee will discuss with
                    you whether thesereports are mere coincidence or an integral part of your philosophyas you apply it.
                    I hope that the committee will consider your understandingof the separation of powers. Here is where
                    I becomevery, very much involved. As a proponent of judicial restraint, youhave on some occasions, I
                    believe, stated that the judiciary shouldnot usurp the authority of the executive or legislative
                    branches ofthe government. And I believe that, too; I think that the judiciaryhas at times usurped
                    the role and the powers—I should say therole, certainly—of the legislative branch.Yet some of your
                    theories and decisions suggest that you consistentlyfavor the supremacy of the executive over the
                    legislativewhen these two authorities are at odds. That may be true; maybe itis not. That is what we
                    should try to find out. I am disturbed ifthat is indeed the case.For example, you testified in 1973
                    against legislation to establishan independent special prosecutor, despite the fact that
                    experienceshows that trusting the executive to investigate itself is a resoundingreaffirmation of
                    the fable of the fox guarding the chicken coop.And in a case decided only this year, I believe you
                    suggested thatwhat is commonly referred to as executive privilege may be delegatedby the President
                    to others.I am interested in knowing more about just how far your viewsgo as to such delegation
                    because of the fear that such a view couldhave had a devastating impact on the public's right to
                    know andthe public's right to discover the abuses of Watergate and the IranContra affair.In the case
                    of Barnes v. Kline, you stated that Congress has noright to bring a court challenge to the improper
                    use of the vetopower by the executive, maintaining that such issues should be decidedin the give and
                    take of politics. Now, if I am wrong in anythingI have said, you will correct me, and I will respect
                    the correction.But I ask a rhetorical question: Why should the country have tosuffer the effects of
                    stalemate and acrimony between two branchesof government?As Alexander Pope said, "Who shall decide
                    when doctors disagree?"So, when the President, when the executive and the legislativedisagree, who
                    shall decide? And my understanding is that nobodyelse should decide other than the Supreme Court or
                    the courts, ultimately,the Supreme Court; and of course, if it is a political thicket,I can
                    understand how in instances it is appropriate to look uponthat as a political question. But we are
                    talking about the pocketveto or the veto power of the President of the United States, vetoinga piece
                    of legislation that has been written by the elected representativesof the people of this country.
                    And a pocket veto is notsomething to be taken lightly. And what are the powers of thePresident of
                    the United States under this Constitution when itcomes to exercising the pocket veto? What is his
                    authority? Wheredoes his authority end?This is not a mere political question. This is a question
                    that mayinvolve the health and welfare for the national defense, for the nationalsecurity of the
                    people of this country.Why should the unconstitutional act, if it be one, of one branchof the
                    government go unchecked? Who will decide such disputes ifnot the Court?I am in agreement with the
                    results of many of your policies as Iunderstand them, particularly in the area of criminal law—the
                    exclusionaryrule. So my feelings very much comport with what Ithink I have observed as having been
                    in your position in certaincases. In my view, some courts have failed to give appropriate
                    considerationto the rights of the majority and the victims of crimesand the potential victims of
                    crimes in criminal cases. Laws de125signed to be tough on criminals are necessary and should be
                    enforced,as you have pointed out.It is difficult to appreciate the argument that the death penaltyis
                    unconstitutional when it is referred to in the Constitution. Capitalpunishment is referred to time
                    and time again in the amendmentsto the Constitution.There is another area of your philosophy that is
                    of particular interestto me—your criticism of the election campaign laws. Followinga period of
                    abuse, Congress passed laws limiting the amount ofcampaign contributions and requiring disclosure of
                    such contributions.Even though the whole Supreme Court upheld the major provisionsof these election
                    laws, I believe you have stated that youbelieve these provisions are unconstitutional as a violation
                    of thefreedom of speech.We have had campaign financing reform legislation, now beforethe Senate, for
                    months. We had the seventh cloture vote on ittoday, and failed to get cloture, so this is very much
                    on my mind atthe moment. But how can one reconcile his aggressiveness againstthis reform legislation
                    with a general philosophy that judgesshould exercise restraint in finding legislation to be
                    unconstitutional?I look forward to your testimony. I know that it will be useful tome in making up
                    my mind on your nomination.I believe that the Court should exercise judicial restraint andthat
                    judges should not substitute their personal views for the willof the people or the Constitution.As
                    Justice Hugo Black observed in 1970 failure of the Court toadhere to the language of the
                    Constitution makes it dangerouslysimple for courts to operate as a continuing Constitutional
                    Convention.I am troubled by the thought, however, of judicial restraint ifit is carried to the
                    extreme, that it can become its own peculiarkind of judicial activism.Therefore our role in the
                    Senate is to determine whether yourtheory of judicial restraint is simply that of a constitutional
                    conservativeor whether it cloaks a private agenda as some have said,to overturn those court
                    decisions with which you openly disagree.As we celebrate the bicentennial of our Constitution, it is
                    entirelyfitting that we discuss the allegiance to and regard for the Constitutionof a person to whom
                    we are contemplating and trustingmajor responsibility for its interpretation and application. I do
                    notquestion your allegiance to that Constitution. I do not have to askyou any questions on that
                    point. I do not have to question yourregard for the Constitution. But the Constitution is no
                    ordinarydocument, and this is no ordinary appointment. And these are notordinary times.The
                    foundation of our Government is that Constitution, and weshould insist on a standard no less than
                    that of the first Chief Justice,John Marshall, who admonished that we must never forgetthat it is
                    the Constitution that we are expounding.Mr. Chairman, I was told that the Senators would have 30
                    minutesfor their opening statements. That constitutes my openingstatement. I would be happy to hear
                    Judge Bork's response. Iwould like to hear him respond if he cares to respond, since I sawhim taking
                    some notes or making some notes. I would be happy tohear his response. And then, may I assure Judge
                    Bork that if Ihave to leave, it will not be through any discourtesy or intention torun away, but I
                    shall follow his appearances here and read withgreat interest the words that he speaks into the
                    record as he respondsto this committee's questions.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NO, no; I would be glad to. The response I will givenow will not be as full
                    as I might give as we get into this.My criticism of the Federal Election Campaign Act was really,
                    asI recall, largely that the contribution limits were too low and thedisclosure limits were too low.
                    And I think I pointed out thatEugene McCarthy's campaign in New Hampshire, which persuadedPresident
                    Johnson not to run again, could not have been financedunder limits that low, and that the disclosure
                    limits were so lowthat a lot of people who would like to support a position or a candidate,but who
                    were in sensitive positions—like a president of a universityor something of that sort—effectively
                    could not contribute.I think, as I understand it, for example, inflation had shrunk thecontribution
                    limit by the time I spoke from $1,000, I think it was,to $700 or $800. As I understand it, you have
                    now indexed that sothat inflation will no longer eat it away.I think my difficulties are more with
                    the levels at which theywere set as being unrealistic enough to raise a problem; andindeed, I think
                    various judges had different—on the SupremeCourt, I think Chief Justice Burger had that problem with
                    the statute,among other things.On Barnes v. Kline, which is my view of congressional standing,that
                    view, Senator, is dictated by my view of judicial restraint.Now, the pocket veto case that you
                    mentioned: I agree, I took theposition in the executive branch, which I think this committee nowhas
                    in its hands, that a pocket veto is not valid where Congress,the Senate and the House, have left an
                    agent to receive that returnveto—even though the House and the Senate are out, adjourned.But the
                    difficulty with allowing in that case Congressmen to suethe President, saying that this pocket veto
                    is unconstitutionalaction, is simply this—the theory was that the Congressmen hadofficial office
                    which was somehow diminished by the President'saction. By parity of reasoning, the President could
                    sue the Congressvery easily. If the Congress passes a bill over his veto, requiring thePresident to
                    do something which he regards as unconstitutional,there is no reason under the reasoning of the
                    other case why hecould not come into the Court down the hill and start a lawsuit todeclare the
                    Congress' bill unconstitutional.Indeed, if you adjust judges' duties in any way, there is no
                    reasonwhy a judge could not sue, and in fact it has gotten to this point.The Court of Appeals for
                    the Seventh Circuit reversed two DistrictCourt judges out there, and the judges petitioned for
                    certiorari onthe grounds that their functions had been damaged. That is whatworries me. If everybody
                    can sue everybody in the government onthe grounds of functions, then every governmental issue will
                    comeinto court instantly and be decided by courts, which would be anenormous expansion of the power
                    of the courts over the other twobranches.In the pocket veto case, I did say explicitly not only that
                    thePresident and the Congress could fight it out, but that if a privateparty brought an action—in
                    fact, that is the way the originalpocket veto cases arose; Indian tribes claiming that they had
                    lostmoney that was due them because of an invalid pocket veto sued.In that kind of a case, I have no
                    problem at all with standing tochallenge a pocket veto. It is only when the Court gets into
                    justgeneral issues between the branches so that every issue comes immediatelyinto court, and the
                    courts decide every aspect of governmentalpower; I think that is unfortunate. And I think that is
                    consistentwith not only my standing rule, but my view of judicial restraint.I cannot recall the case
                    in which I talked about the President—Idid not think I said the President could delegate executive
                    privilegeto others; I think I said—I would have to check this—I think Isaid that there was reason to
                    believe that those officials who arepart of the Presidency and who communicate with the
                    Presidentmight have executive privilege to that extent. I did not decide theissue. What I was doing
                    was protesting that the majority which diddecide the issue, decided it the other way, and I did not
                    think itwas up before us, and I just suggested that it might go the otherway from the way they went
                    if it were before us.But I will have fuller answers to all of these questions, Senator. Iam not even
                    sure I got all of your points down here.</p>

                    difficult for you to be here.I am going to trespass 60 more seconds on the ranking member'stime
                    here, just so you have time, or your staff—you asked aboutthe quote from Griswold and where I got
                    it. It was on page 9 ofthe neutral principles article, in the Indiana Law Journal, and Iwill quote
                    it:Griswold, then, is an unprincipled decision, both in the way in which it derives anew
                    constitutional right and the way in which it defines the right or, rather, fails todefine it, where,
                    left with no idea of the sweep of the right to privacy and have nonotion of the cases to which it
                    may or may not be applied in the future. The truth isthat the Court could not reach its result in
                    Griswold through principle. The reasonis obvious. Every clash between minorities claiming freedom
                    and majorities claimingpower to regulate involves a choice between gratifications of two groups.
                    Whenthe Constitution has not spoken, the Court will be able to find no scale other thanits own value
                    preferences upon which to weigh the respective claims of pleasure."Compare the facts in Griswold
                    with the hypothetical suit by an electric utilitycompany and one of its customers to void a smoke
                    pollution ordinance as unconstitutional.The cases are identical. In Griswold, a husband and wife
                    assert that theyhave a right to sexual relations without fear of unwanted children. The law
                    impairstheir gratification,et cetera. That is page 9.And then</p>

                    Well, I think I would look and be absolutelysure that the prior decision was incorrectly decided.
                    That is necessary.And if it is wrongly decided—and you have to give respectto your predecessors'
                    judgment on these matters—the presumptionagainst overruling remains, because it may be that there
                    are privateexpectations built up on the basis of the prior decision. It maybe that governmental and
                    private institutions have grown uparound that prior decision. There is a need for stability and
                    conti129nuity in the law. There is a need for predictability in legal doctrine.And it is important
                    that the law not be considered as shiftingevery time the personnel of the Supreme Court changes.So
                    those are some of the factors I would consider as reasons touphold a prior decision. There are also
                    reasons to overrule it. Icould list those factors, too.</p>

                    clearly gives majorities the right to rule largeareas of life simply because they are majorities.
                    And that is a freedom,that is a liberty, of the majority. The Constitution also saysthere are some

                    known as the resolutionof what has been called "James Madison's dilemma".But if a judge steps into
                    an area that the Constitution says is formajorities and says the majority may not do these things,
                    despitewhat the Constitution says, then he has taken away a majorityfreedom and placed it in the

                    academic exercise and engaging in adebate and trying out a theory has become somehow the core of
                    myphilosophy. The article itself said at the end that these remarksare intended to be tentative and
                    exploratory. At the moment, I donot see how I can avoid them.My views have changed for the simple
                    reason—I was looking fora bright-line test by which judges could decide which speech wasprotected
                    and which was not. I have since become persuaded—infact, I was persuaded by my colleagues very
                    quickly—that thebright-line made no sense; it would be impossible to follow. There isno reason, if
                    somebody wants to engage in moral discourse to say itis not protected unless he ends it by saying,
                    "and therefore, I proposethat we pass a law."So my bright-line eroded, and I now think—I have for
                    sometime—first amendment protection applies to moral discourse, it appliesto scientific speech, it
                    applies to news, it applies to opinion, itapplies to literature. I gave up my attempt to construct a

                <p class="short_transcript">In that case, Senator, Congress had passed a witnessprotection statute
                    which, as I recall, did not deal with this issue. Inthis case, it was a witness who married a
                    divorced woman withchildren, and they disappeared in this program—and the divorcedhusband could not
                    find his children. Now, it seemed to me therewere two solutions to that. One, which was my idea, was
                    to get thatissue back in Congress, because Congress had not faced it, and I donot know, really,
                    whether it wanted to do that. And therefore, Isaid I am not at all sure that this program does not
                    violate Pennsylvaniadomestic relations law, and it is not clear that Congressintended to preempt the
                    domestic relations laws of the States.I thought a holding along those lines would put the issue back
                    inCongress where it could be considered and a legislative solutionworked out, and it also gives this
                    fellow his rights.But a majority of my Court decided to create a new constitutionalright, right
                    there. I think you reach a constitutional right, newor old, only if—you do not reach it if you can
                    first get the Congressof the United States to decide whether they really want to do thisthing or
                    not; then you face the constitutional question.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NO, I do not think it does, Senator, but let me makea preparatory remark.I
                    have seen some evidence that the likelihood that the amendmentwas intended to stop segregation is
                    greater than I had originallythought, and that Plessy v. Ferguson and the later segregationlaws came
                    afterwards, when the Supreme Court had changedand the legislatures had changed in the South. So that
                    as a matterof original intent, I am not at all sure that segregation was not intendedto be
                    eliminated.But let me proceed on the assumption that separate but equalwas intended by those who
                    framed the 14th amendment. The rulethey wrote was no individual shall be denied the equal
                    protectionof the law. They may have written that rule on the assumption—abackground assumption—that
                    you could get equal protection orequality with separation or segregation.If they did, then by 1954
                    it had become abundantly clear that thebackground assumption was false. You cannot get equality
                    withsegregation. At that point the Court is faced with a choice: Does itenforce the rule—equal
                    protection—or enforce the background assumptionthat the framers and ratifiers made. I think it is
                    clearthat you have to enforce the rule, the background assumptionbeing false, and that leads
                    directly to no segregation, and it leadsto Brown v. Board of Education.</p>

                    affirmative action, which I fully supported, was thatinstitutions should reach out to inform
                    minorities and so forth thatopportunities of certain sorts existed that they may not know
                    existed,and to reach out and try to identify and help qualified individualsinto those.Later on,
                    those programs begin to change into programs aboutspecified numbers of people being brought in
                    differently. Thatbegan to worry me. I certainly would not have minded preferentialtreatment by
                    private institutions for a period of time, until wecould bring blacks and other racial minorities

                    because that leads to resentment from other groups. Itwill lead to demands for preferences from
                    other groups; it will leadto individuals feeling that they earned something and will neverget it

                <p class="short_transcript">Yes, certainly, Senator. At the time I wrote aboutthe equal protection
                    clause, the Court had never extended theclause to women. But in addition to that, as I think I said
                    in replyto another Senator—perhaps, the Chairman—the Court was in theprocess of saying it applies to
                    blacks, it applies to illegitimate children,it applies to somebody else, and they were picking
                    groups—which I thought was a wrong way to apply it. I think you apply itby requiring a reasonable
                    basis for any distinction made betweenindividuals or groups.Now, in the case of race, it will be
                    impossible, virtually, to find areasonable distinction that will justify discrimination.In the case
                    of gender, it will depend on the particular issue.While it is possible to say in the area of race,
                    no difference of treatment,it is not entirely possible to say that in the case of gender,simply
                    because of physical differences. Combat—maybe the equalprotection clause does not require that.But
                    in that sense, requiring a reasonable basis for any distinctionmade—yes, the clause applies to
                    women; it applies to every person.</p>

                    wrote that letter. The fact is anyjudge, when he sits down to write, sometimes has the
                    experiencethat it will not write that way; you agreed on a ground, and it willnot write that way.
                    That is what happened in this case.I then went back to Roger Robb, who was the senior judge on
                    thepanel, and talked to him about it and explained to him I thought astanding issue would go much
                    better than a political question doctrineissue or a speech and debate issue. And I gave him the
                    reasons—I will not spell them all out here, but they are in the papers.He agreed—I thought. I left,
                    and drafted it. I should have writtento Judge Gordon then. He was down in Kentucky. I did not. I
                    redraftedit.The fact is that Judge Robb's secretary remembers me coming into have that conversation;
                    my clerks remember me going up andcoming back and saying that Judge Robb had agreed.I then sent
                    the—I have some documents about this here, Senator,if I can find them—I then sent the draft around
                    to Judge Robb,who was in the hospital with a broken hip—he had fallen—and toJudge Gordon.The letter
                    I sent with the draft to Judge Gordon says, "It occursto me too late, that I should have notified
                    you in advance that Ihad changed the rationale in the Vander Jagt case to one of lack ofstanding.
                    After I got started on the opinion, it became apparentthat it was harder to dispose of the case
                    under either the politicalquestion doctrine or the Speech or Debate Clause. The SupremeCourt's
                    opinion in Valley Forge, on the other hand, made it relativelyeasy to dispose of the case on the
                    standing ground. This tackwas also indicated because there are some en bane rehearings [rehearingsof
                    our full Court] coming up in this circuit for which theother two grounds might have implications."I
                    did not want to seem to be deciding the en bane court's casesfor them in advance."That would have
                    complicated the writing of the opinion basedupon political question or Speech and Debate.""In any

                    wishes, sincerely."So we went on. Then Judge Gordon was assigned the task ofwriting the opinion on
                    yet a fourth ground, one that had not beendiscussed at the conference, and there is a memorandum
                    from mehere to both of those judges which is too long to read at themoment</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">The letter to Judge Gordon is September 24, 1982; itis when I transmitted
                    the—oh, I am sorry—I appear to have misstated.I sent the draft to both Judge Robb and Judge Gordon,
                    andthen a week later I sent this letter explaining why I had changedthe rationale to Judge Gordon.
                    Judge Gordon then redrafted theopinion on a new basis and sent it around and I wrote a
                    concurringopinion. Now, after all of this had happened and after an experience,which Judge Gordon
                    now says caused him to think that I wastrying to sneak an opinion past him. He sent his draft
                    back—andthere was never any discussion of this—he sent his draft back andclosed the letter with "May
                    I take this opportunity of expressing toyou my pleasure in sitting with you last March and the
                    making ofyour acquaintance, and I wish for you and yours a happy andjoyous Yuletide Season," which
                    did not alert me to the fact that hethought he had, in any way, been run around.But the accusation
                    is preposterous in any event, Senator, becausewhen I circulate a draft, the other two judges read it
                    and theirclerks read it. There is no way to write a draft that they are goingto miss and will go out
                    and become the law. In addition to that,there is a rule in our circuit that when the other two
                    judges haveconcurred in your draft, you circulate the draft to the full Court,which I think was 11
                    judges at that time, and their clerks all readit.So, the thought that anybody would try to run a
                    minority opinionthrough that full Court is just preposterous. There is nothing tothe charge. The
                    memories of the people involved, the documentation,and the practicalities of the circumstances
                    indicate that it isjust—I do not know what it is but it is certainly a misunderstanding.</p>

                    Bork, some of our critics haveaccused you of taking a very broad view of the President's powersand a
                    narrow view of the powers of the Congress. With that inmind, I would like you to comment on the
                    memorandum you wroteto Attorney General Levi in 1976, in which you offered that someuses of the
                    pocket veto were constitutionally suspect and shouldnot be allowed or followed by President Ford.Is
                    this an example in which you are for a narrower view of Presidentialpower than some of your
                    colleagues in the Ford administrationand is it true that President Ford eventually issued a
                    statementessentially adopting your position?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That is all true, Senator. Senator Kennedy was theplaintiff in a case known
                    as Kennedy v. Sampson, challenging—Ithink it was a pocket veto, wasn't it, Senator, and I was then
                    SolicitorGeneral.I chose not to appeal that case or try to get that caseinto the Supreme Court
                    because I thought it was a terrible caseand we would lose it.I then communicated my decision on that
                    to the Attorney Generaland executive branch. The White House knew about it. I cannotremember who I
                    talked to. They began to use some form of an intermediateveto which said that something like this is
                    a returnveto but if it is not, it is a pocket veto, or vice versa, something likethat. I got
                    disturbed by that because, since I had not taken theother case up or tried to get it up, I did not
                    think they were free touse it.The Attorney General, Mr. Levi and I, discussed it, in which
                    discussionI told him that if the administration insisted upon goingahead with those cases and took
                    them to the Supreme Court, Iwould not participate. I would not sign the brief and I would notargue
                    the case. We then, in my office, prepared a legal memorandumto the White House explaining that the
                    pocket veto ought tobe interpreted according to the purpose for which it was designed.It was clearly
                    designed to prevent a Congress from passing a lawand leaving town so that the President had no
                    opportunity to givea return veto. When the Congress leaves behind an agent to receivea return veto,
                    it seems to me that purpose is satisfied and thepocket veto should not be used. That was a position
                    I took insidethe administration, over some opposition, but ultimately we persuadedthe President to
                    that position.</p>

                    acommon recollection, at least it is shared by a lot of people at thatmeeting, that I said they were

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. JudgeBork, I wanted to pick up, for a
                    moment, one aspect of the line ofquestioning of the Chairman. As I understand your discussion ofthe
                    Griswold case, your view is that there is no right to privacy inthe Constitution. It is up to the
                    legislature. Doesn't that lead you tothe view that you would uphold a statute requiring say,
                    compulsoryabortion, if a legislature enacted it by majority?Let me just continue. Some of your
                    strongest supporters havemade an issue of the allegation that there may be compulsory abortionin the
                    People's Republic of China. As I understand it, underyour peculiar constitutional philosophy, you
                    would be prepared touphold compulsory abortion in America if some future legislatureenacted it. We
                    have just heard you say that the State of Connecticuthad the right to pass a law prohibiting married
                    couples fromusing birth control.I think the real question is, Where do you draw the line? I thinkyou
                    have opened up a whole can of worms, quite frankly, here.What about a State statute that says
                    families with more than twochildren cannot send their children to public schools? What aboutall
                    sorts of other statutes that a legislature might enact with sometheoretically-plausible rationale,
                    such as the Connecticut statute,but which would obviously violate the people's most
                    fundamentalrights, including the right to privacy?I believe, Mr. Bork, that in your world, the
                    individuals have preciousfew rights to protect them against the majority and I thinkthis is where
                    the Bill of Rights comes in and what the Bill ofRights is all about, that there are some things in
                    America whichno majority can do to the minority or to the individuals. The provisionsof the 14th
                    amendment under section 1, include "nor shallany State deprive any person of life, liberty or
                    property withoutthe due process of law."Isn't included in the concept of liberty, the right to
                    privacy? Inreading that term with the ninth amendment, which provides that"the enumeration in the
                    Constitution of certain rights shall not beconstrued to deny or disparage others retained by the
                    people," Iwould be interested in your reaction or response because it seemsto me that the issues of
                    privacy have been carefully enshrinedwithin the Constitution by court decisions over the period of
                    thelast 60 years.They are rights which are enshrined in such a way and respectedand valued so
                    importantly that I would think Americans wouldhave serious questions, I certainly do, about placing
                    someone onthe Supreme Court that is willing to find some kind of a rationale,or appears to find some
                    rationale, not to respect it.</p>

                    What we weretalking about here was a generalized, undefined right of privacywhich is not in the Bill

                    fromthe text, the history and the structure of the Constitution.There are important aspects of
                    privacy in the Bill of Rights. ThisCongress has increased privacy in many ways by statute. As a

                    response to the chairman's questionswith regard to the Griswold. We remember that the majorityin
                    that case found that the provisions in a State statute that restrictedmarried couples from using
                    contraception would be violativeof their right to privacy. You've indicated that you took issuewith
                    the rationale.I think you continued and said, well, perhaps someone can comeup with a different
                    rationale so that you might be able to reach adifferent decision. But in response, I think, to the
                    chairman's question,you talked about the importance of the majority in the Statelegislatures. You
                    did not find, at least at this time, that you wereprepared to state a philosophy or legal
                    justification for the overrulingof that Connecticut statute. I believe, quite frankly, followingthat
                    rationale, that you could lead yourself into the kinds of situationswhich I've posed here. If I am
                    wrong, I would like to hearfrom you on that.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, let me repeat about this created, generalizedand undefined right of
                    privacy in Griswold. Aside from the factthat the right was not derived by Justice Douglas, in any
                    traditionalmode of constitutional analysis, there is this. The right wasnot—we do not know what it
                    is. We do not know what it covers. Itcan strike at random. For example the Supreme Court has not
                    appliedthe right of privacy consistently and I think it is safe to predictthat the Supreme Court
                    will not.For example, if it really is a right of sexual freedom in private,as some people have
                    suggested, then Bowers v. Hardwick, whichupheld a statute against sodomy as applied to homosexuals,
                    iswrongly decided. Privacy to do what, Senator? You know, privacyto use cocaine in private? Privacy
                    for businessmen to fix prices in ahotel room? We just do not know what it is.</p>

                    government intrusion, in terms ofthe married couple in the Griswold case, in terms of their use
                    ofcontraceptives, did go across that line; and in the kind of examplesthat I have given you, it
                    would seem to me that that would be equallyclear, that a State statute that required compulsory
                    abortion wouldcertainly violate what I think most Americans would feel would bethe right to privacy.
                    And I believe as well that, once you have theState dictating the size of families, it would do so as

                <p class="short_transcript">I was basically interested, rather than gettinginto the cases, just to get
                    at the rationale, the reasoning, the waythat you do move to reach a decision. Let me go to the
                    issues ofequality.I think most Americans are proud that our Supreme Court, forits leadership in the
                    past 30 years in securing the promise of equaljustice under law for all Americans, for striking down
                    the JimCrow laws, vindicating the right to vote, and prohibiting discriminationagainst women.The
                    Court has helped to bring to an end the reign of prejudiceand, I think, create a better America. You
                    have written a greatdeal, over the years, about legislation and court decisions designedto ensure
                    equal justice under law and I would like to examine someof these views.Perhaps the most significant
                    moral test of the country in thiscentury occurred in the struggle to end race discrimination. I
                    appreciateyour support for the school desegregation decision in 1954,but I am troubled because I
                    believe that your clock on civil rightsseems to have stopped in 1954. You opposed the passage of the
                    CivilRights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination in public accommodationsand employment.The
                    terrible burden of segregation in that period was describedby Attorney General Robert Kennedy, in
                    his testimony before thiscommittee in support of the Civil Rights Act of 1963, I just quotevery
                    briefly, "Consider also the enumerable difficulties that face aNegro just travelling from State to
                    State in our country, somethingthe rest of us have taken for granted. He makes a reservation
                    inadvance. They may not be honored. If he seeks accommodationsalong the way, he's likely to be
                    rejected time after time until, justto obtain lodging and food, he must detour widely from his
                    route,and if he does find accommodations available to him, they arelikely to be inferior."That was
                    the reality in America in 1963. That was the evil thatthe Civil Rights Act was intended to prohibit,
                    but, Mr. Bork, youdid not just criticize, you harshly criticized, the public
                    accommodationsprovisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in your 1963 "NewRepublic" article, printed
                    rather interestingly in August of 1963 atthe time of Dr. King's march to Washington, where he
                    stirred thenation.In your "New Republic" article, you referred to the principle underlyingthose
                    provisions as "a principle of unsurpassed ugliness."And then in your article of March 1, 1964, in
                    the Chicago Tribune,you also expressed your opposition to the public accommodationsprovision and to
                    the title of the proposed Civil Right Act thatwould end discrimination in employment as well. Isn't
                    that correct?</p>

                    to know that as Solicitor General, I enforced therights of racial minorities, in court, often
                    further than the SupremeCourt was willing to go. You should also know, Senator, thaton my present
                    court, I have frequently voted for black plaintiffs invarious kinds of civil rights or voting rights
                    cases.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I am indeed. Indeed, I did not have to go that far ifI did not want to. I
                    think it is important to know how this cameabout. I had come to Yale as an avid free market type. I
                    had gotteninto classical economics, which teaches that by and large, it ismuch better to let people
                    arrange their own affairs and their owntransactions than to try to govern them by law. I made, what
                    I nowregard as a not uncommon intellectual mistake of trying to applythose principles to social
                    interactions. I do not think it works therebecause you have not got a marketplace to discipline
                    people.But, it is not uncommon for free market economists to displaylibertarian principles. This
                    article came about because I was arguingwith Alex Bickel about this subject. I, at that time,
                    thoughtthat any coercion of the individual by government, had to be justifiedby a principle that did
                    not lead government into all kinds ofcoercion that should not be there and I could not see a
                    generalphilosophical principle here that justified this coercion.I also could not see a general
                    philosophical principle that wouldjustify segregation by law. I was leaning on the side of
                    individualfreedom. I think that was wrong because I do not think any generalprinciple is available.
                    I now take what I would call—at leastwhat Bickel described as—the Edmund Burke approach, which
                    is,you look at each measure—this is a political matter, not a judicialmatter—you look at each
                    measure and ask whether it will do moregood than harm.Had I looked at the civil rights proposals in
                    that way, I wouldhave, as I later came to, recognize that they do much more good. Infact, they make
                    everybody much happier and they help bring thenation together in a way that otherwise would not have
                    occurred.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, the broadcasting of the opposition took placeentirely because I got
                    into an argument with Alex Bickel. He wrotefrequently for the "New Republic" and he asked me to
                    write it up.I must say that when he saw it, he said, your article is a version ofliberal thought.
                    Let me say one other thing. The concern about therights of liberty, as well as equality, was by no
                    means an unusualone then. When Congress came to face the fair housing laws, Congressbegan to make
                    exceptions for Mrs. Murphy's boardinghousebecause they were worried about coercing the individual in
                    thatway.A few years after I wrote this article, Justice Harlan dissented ina lunch counter sit-in
                    case, talking about the freedom of the individualand the rights of equality as being competing
                    constitutionalconsiderations. I think I was wrong there. I do not think I was inbad company, with
                    Justice Harlan and this Congress, but those areserious matters and it is no small thing to coerce
                    generally.Now, I was afraid that the principle of this legislation could leadto coercion of
                    association everywhere. I now realize that we legislatepartially and never legislate on a general
                    principle so thatthere is no danger that this kind of thing would expand into otherareas of
                    coercion.</p>

                    demonstratedas much concern about the coercion that was happening tothose black citizens that were
                    being coerced as you apparentlywere concerned about others.Let me go to the issue of poll taxes. The
                    right to vote is the cornerstoneof a free society. For decades poll taxes were used to keeppoor
                    Americans, often of racial minorities, from exercising thefranchise. In Harper v. Virginia Board of
                    Elections, which was decidedin 1966, the Supreme Court struck down the poll tax becauseit deprived
                    poor Americans of equal protection of the laws by barringthem from exercising their fundamental
                    right to vote.In its majority opinion the court stated: "Wealth or fee payinghas, in our view, no
                    relation to voting qualifications. The right tovote is too precious, too fundamental to be so
                    burdened or conditioned."Judge Bork, is it not true that in your confirmation hearings tobe
                    Solicitor General in 1973 you testified that you thought thatHarper, and I quote, "as an equal
                    protection case seemed to bewrongly decided."You were asked whether as far as the welfare of the
                    nation wasconcerned the Harper case was correctly decided. Am I correct thatyou answered, "I do not
                    really know about that. As I recall it was avery small poll tax. It was not discriminatory and I
                    doubt it hadmuch impact on the welfare of the nation one way or the other."And then you were asked
                    about the constitutional issue, and youresponded, "I think that is a question of degree. It depends
                    on thesize of the poll tax."Do you remember? Is that accurate?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I think it was, and I will tell you why, and I haveno desire to bring poll
                    taxes back into existence. I do not like themmyself. But if that had been a poll tax applied in a
                    discriminatoryfashion, it would have clearly been unconstitutional. It was not. Imean, there was no
                    showing in the case. It was just a $1.50 polltax.This Congress had just recently drafted and
                    proposed to theStates and had adopted an anti-poll tax amendment to the Constitutionwhich this
                    Congress carefully limited to federal elections soas to leave State poll taxes in place if States
                    chose to have them.That seemed to me a little odd, therefore, that the Court wouldcome along and mop
                    up something that Congress did not bother toamend the Constitution to accomplish. Not did not
                    bother; deliberatelydid not.The poll tax was familiar in American history and nobody everthought it
                    was unconstitutional unless it was racially discriminatory.Now, in Harper itself Justice Black—who
                    was hardly a manwho was insensitive to voting rights—Justice Harlan and JusticeStewart all dissented
                    from the majority holding. Justice Black saidthe Court was using the old natural law due process
                    formula towrite into the Constitution notions of what it thinks is good governmentpolicy.Harper
                    overruled a prior case in which the majority had upheldthe poll tax and in that case Justices Black,
                    Frankfurter, Jacksonand others upheld the poll tax. Archibald Cox has said, and Iquote, "the opinion
                    seems almost perversely to repudiate every conventionalguide to legal judgment," although he liked
                    the result. Ilike the result too. I just do not see the legal judgment there.Alexander Bickel made
                    much the same criticism. It is a decisionthat is hard to square with out constitutional history.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, it was not only on the basis of race. Itwas also on the question of
                    discrimination against the poor. Iremember very well, because I offered that amendment on theVoting
                    Rights Act. I suppose the question is, how high a price shoulda poor person have to be able to pay
                    to exercise the fundamentalright to vote. You and I may not have to worry about where eachdollar
                    goes but there are a lot of Americans who do. To suggest that apoll tax, if it is small enough, does
                    not deprive a poor person of afundamental aspect of citizenship, well that reminds me of
                    AnatoleFrance's famous remark that "the law in its majestic equality forbidsthe rich as well as the
                    poor to sleep under bridges and to begin the streets and to steal bread."The oath every judge and
                    justice takes requires them to do equalright to the poor as well as to the rich. I just think we
                    have to besensitive to the realities, not just legal technicalities.Let me go to one man, one vote.
                    In years past, one of the greatobstacles to real democratic representation in the country
                    occurredwhen State legislatures apportioned themselves in ways that systematicallyreduced the voting
                    strength of particular constituencies,drawing election districts with different size populations
                    toenable some groups to maintain more of their share of power atthe expense of others.Judge Bork, in
                    the Reynolds v. Sirns case back in 1964, the SupremeCourt held that the Constitution requires
                    election districtsin States and localities to be apportioned in a way that meets theone man, one
                    vote standard so that each legislative district containsroughly equal population.Is it not true that
                    in 1968 you wrote in Fortune Magazine, and Iquote: "On no reputable theory of constitutional
                    adjudication wasthere an excuse for the doctrine it imposed."</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That is entirely true. On the other hand, the reasonfor allowing certain
                    units to have equal votes, even though theirpopulations are not equal, applies as well in a State
                    legislature orState senate as it does here. But passing that, it should be said thatI agreed with
                    Baker v. Carr, which was the case which first held—over the dissent of Justices Frankfurter and
                    Harlan—which firstheld that the courts could get into reapportionment. It was a subjectmatter they
                    could take up. I agreed with that because the legislaturein that case was so mal-apportioned that a
                    majority of thevoters had no opportunity to get a new apportionment plan.Now, it should be said that
                    my position was the position thatJustice Stewart took in Lucas v.Ji.Jf.th General Assembly in
                    dissent.There you had a reapportionment plan with a State senate basedon counties, I believe, which
                    had been adopted by a referendumwith a majority vote in every county in the State.Justice Stewart
                    wrote, and I explicitly agree with it, that a Stateshould be free to apportion as it sees fit, so
                    long as the apportionmentplan has rationality and so long as a majority has a way tochange the
                    apportionment whenever it wants to. That seems to bemy point, and I must say it is a point that has
                    been agreed to by agreat number of law professors.There is nothing in our constitutional history
                    that suggests oneman, one vote is the only proper way of apportioning. There isnothing in our
                    political theory. Indeed, the executive veto, the committeesystem, districting, all of those things
                    are really inconsistentwith one man, one vote.</p>

                    which prevented poor people fromexercising their fundamental right to vote; and you also opposedthe
                    Supreme Court decision upholding the one man, one vote principlewhich requires that every citizen's
                    vote be counted equally.With all your ability, I just wish you had devoted even a little ofyour
                    talent to advancing equal rights rather than criticizing somany of the decisions protecting rights
                    and liberties.Lawyers can always make technical points, but a justice ought tobe fair.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, for this reason Senator, let us talk about aState like Colorado, all
                    of whose—not all of—the majority of whosecitizens in every county want a State senate structured
                    like thefederal Senate. Why is it an advancement of civil liberties to saythey cannot have it. I
                    think it cuts into the liberties of the voterswho want to have a senate structured in that way. But
                    more fundamentally,you cannot apply the principle of one man, one voteacross the board unless you
                    think that we could do away with thecommittee systems, we could do away with the executive veto,
                    wecould do away with districting instead of at-large elections, and soforth and so on.These points
                    are all made with great precision in advance of theCourt adopting the point in Dean Phil C. Neils
                    article in the SupremeCourt Review that came out just about a year before theReynolds case, I guess,
                    and was made at great length. Nobodydoubts that an apportionment which is discriminatory can
                    bestruck down. Nobody doubts that an apportionment which a majoritycannot change should be struck
                    down. The only question iswhether this rigid formula is good or not.And let me tell you one other
                    thing, Senator. For my sins I wasapproached by a three-judge district court in Connecticut and
                    saidthey had just struck down the plan put in by the legislature andwould I serve as a special
                    master to redistrict Connecticut. I said,Judge Blumenfeld, I have just written that one man, one
                    vote is afiasco—and that was my word, I am afraid—but I will do it. I willfollow the rules if you
                    want me to do it that way, despite the factthat I have written that, and he said, yes.So I then went
                    out and got all of the census tracks and began totry to remake Connecticut. Well, I was not too well
                    received up inHartford because when I went into the legislatures they were terrifiedit was a Yale
                    professor with a beard that they had never heardof before. I remember they looked at a map on the
                    wall and saidsomewhat caustically, that is Connecticut, professor. And I said, fornow.
                    [Laughter.]But I did it. I did it on a one man, one vote basis and within 1percent deviation from
                    district to district, which means you havegot to cut town lines and carve communities up in the
                    strangestways. And I did it blind, just on the numbers without any understandingof the political
                    impact and I first understood the politicalimpact when I went up to testify at the hearing. I went
                    to a restaurantwithout being told it was the Democratic parties hangout. Iwas sitting there eating
                    when a man I did not know came up andsaid, that is a wonderful plan, professor; you are a good man;
                    myname is John Bailey, Democratic national committeeman. He waschairman of the Democratic national
                    committee.Well, the court accepted my plan and the Republicans appealed.But I know from that
                    experience just how artificial one man, onevote leads you to be in cutting up communities and
                    natural groupsand so forth. A little more leeway in the apportionment rules,which—as a matter of
                    fact in that case the Court came to allowmore leeway so that it is not one man, one vote in state
                    electionsanymore. And I think that was a good relaxation.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">YOU had said that cases of racial discriminationaside, it is always a
                    mistake for the Court to try and constructsubstantive individual rights under the due process
                    clause—or theequal protection clause.If I could just go on, there is something else I am driving
                    at.Is it not true that in an interview with United States InformationAgency in June of this year, 10
                    years after the Court applied arigorous standard test to sex discrimination, you said, and I quote,
                    "Ido think the equal protection clause probably should have been keptto things like race and
                    ethnicity."This is after the Supreme Court changed its basic test. It is clearfrom your public
                    comments as recently as 3 months ago that youdisapprove of the Supreme Court's recognition in the
                    past 10 yearsthat laws which discriminate on the basis of sex must be subject toheightened scrutiny
                    under the 14th amendment. Because under therational basis test, the Supreme Court upholds a
                    classification if itis rationally related to any government interest. That is a very lenientstandard
                    used by the courts in judging routine economic regulationsthat treat different persons and
                    businesses differently.That distinction was mentioned by the Chairman. In 1976, theSupreme Court
                    rejected the rational basis test and applied a stricterstandard for sex discrimination. And yet, in
                    June of this year,you said that decision trivialized the Constitution. In this day andage men and
                    women stand equal before the law. Women are firstclasscitizens, Mr. Bork, and your views would take
                    us back to thedays when women were second-class citizens and the SupremeCourt winked at
                    discrimination and denied equal rights for women.</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Well, let me talk about that, Senator. In looking atthe 14th amendment, race
                    is the paradigm case. Race is the core ofthe amendment. That is what the post-Civil War amendments
                    werebasically aimed at. They wanted to help and prevent discriminationagainst the newly freed
                    slaves. And of course, race and ethnicity—that is the way the amendment was applied for a long time.
                    Itwas applied to Chinese Americans in Yick Wo v. Hopkins.At least for the last 90 years, roughly,
                    the Court has also beendoing two things. It has been using a reasonable basis test, but ithas also
                    engaged in the activity you described, by saying this groupis in under the 14th amendment, that
                    group is out.Then they would develop multi-tier levels of scrutiny. That is,racial discrimination or
                    distinction required strict scrutiny by thecourts and a compelling governmental interest. Gender
                    began toget intermediate scrutiny or something of that sort. I think thatapproach is highly
                    artificial and not sufficient. I think you do nothave to say this group is in, that group is out.
                    You say that all personsare in, as the amendment does, and then you apply a reasonablebasis test.The
                    reasonable basis test got a bad name because it simply is notapplied with any degree of severity at
                    all in the case of economiccases, and maybe it should not be. Maybe those are interest grouppolitics
                    cases. But if you look at—ask yourself whether a reasonablebasis for distinction exists, the answer
                    will be in a race case,almost never; in a gender case you will get something that
                    resemblesintermediate scrutiny, but you do not have to go through puttinggroups in and out and you
                    do not have to have different tiersof scrutiny.And indeed, I think Justice Stevens made a similar
                    point, ormaybe the same point, in a recent opinion of his. It gives women—women were not thought of
                    as protected in particular when the14th amendment was applied. There was a lot of what we now
                    calldiscrimination against women which seemed to them a very naturalway for civilization to be
                    organized. But as the culture changesand as the position of women in society changes, those
                    distinctionswhich seemed reasonable now seem outmoded stereotypes and theyseem unreasonable and they
                    get struck down.That is the way a reasonable basis test should be applied.</p>

                    yearsago the Court altered that to a rigorous standard for sex discrimination.As I understand the
                    rational basis test, it is the same testwhich is used in terms of economic regulations and pollution
                    ordinances.You have restated earlier in your response to ChairmanBiden that this is still your test
                    whereas the Court itself has movedto a much more rigorous standard to sex discrimination.</p>

                    standard test and that does provide a greatdeal more protection to women.What I hear you saying here
                    now is that the test that was usedabout 90 years ago and which was the basis for
                    discriminationagainst women is the standard that you would use. You might beable to elaborate on it,

                    over the last 16 years, Mr. Bork,you have suggested the equal protection clause of the
                    Constitutiondoes not ban discrimination against women. Now you are suggestingthe Supreme Court
                    should apply the same lax standard to sexdiscrimination cases that it applies to challenges to air
                    pollutionordinances or economic regulations.You have also disapproved the equal rights amendment,
                    and finallyyou also suggested in a 1985 opinion that the Civil Rights Actoffers little if any
                    protection against any one of the ugliest forms ofgender discrimination, individual sexual
                    harassment on the job. Wehave made great progress in the country in the last 20 years ingiving women
                    equal status under law and I think the controversyhas largely been settled. But you would have the
                    Supreme Court,evidently, roll back the clock and reopen old wounds.</p>

                    ERA except that it seemed to me odd toput all of the decisions about how women may be
                    treated—whatthey may do and what they may not do and so forth—into thehands of judges without any
                    guidelines from a legislative history oranything else. Had the ERA said, Congress may make such laws
                    asit sees fit to remove gender inequality, I would have no objection.My objection to ERA—which I
                    never campaigned against, I justdropped a footnote someplace—was essentially the same as my
                    objectionwhich I have voiced to this administration's balancedbudget amendment. In one case you put
                    all the relationships betweenthe sexes in the hands of judges where it should be in thehands of
                    legislatures, except when it violates the Constitution. Inthe other case, you are going to put this
                    government's finances inthe hands of judges, or the budget in the hands of judges.It does not seem
                    to me that judges are fit for either of thosetasks without a lot more guidance than either amendment

                    go into combat, about whether weshould have unisex toilets and all of this business you are going
                    toleave to judges.That was my only objection to the unstructured grant of powerto the judiciary.</p>

                    cover some of these areas that you havebeen discussing with Senator Kennedy and others.I might say,
                    Mr. Chairman, in response to a question from SenatorThurmond, Judge Bork referred to recommendations
                    he madein connection with the pocket veto case brought by our colleagueSenator Kennedy.In this
                    memorandum, Judge Bork, who was the then SolicitorGeneral, advised the Attorney General and
                    President Nixon thatthe pocket veto could only be used under limited circumstances, soI ask
                    unanimous consent that this memorandum be placed in therecord at this point.</p>

                    matter of fact, I don't see how anybodywatching this could doubt that you're an eminent scholar,
                    with abrilliant mind, who is in the mainstream of judicial life, who in sittingin more than 400
                    cases on the Circuit Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia has never been reversed, who has
                    been withinthe mainstream with his liberal colleagues on the Courts, if that'san appropriate term,
                    as you have with your conservative colleagues,having agreed 90 percent of the time with Judge
                    RuthBader Ginsburg, 83 percent of the time with Judge Mikya, right ondown to Judge Skelly Wright
                    around 75 percent of the time.That doesn't sound to me like you're outside of the mainstream,since
                    you're agreeing with your liberal colleagues. But they havechosen in some of these critical articles
                    to criticize you on 14 percentof your cases, where there is tremendous controversy. That'sunfair,
                    and we have a tendency up here, as Senators, because wedon't have the time to go into the nuances of
                    these cases as youjudges do, to look at everything in terms of 30-second bites for uson television.
                    That's my point, not you.Now, in recent years we have heard a great deal of commentaryabout the
                    problems of judicial activism. How would you define judicialactivism, because this seems to be
                    really one of the centralcore matters here.</p>

                    Constitution his personal policy preferences—and let me be clear about this.No human being can sit
                    down with words in a statute, with historyand the other evidence he uses, and not to some extent get
                    hispersonal moral view into it, because each of us sees the world, understandsfacts, through a lens
                    composed of our morality and ourunderstanding.But there is an enormous difference between that
                    inevitable biasthat gets in and a judge who self-consciously tries to keep hisbiases out and tries
                    to be as impartial on the evidence as he can be.There's an enormous difference between that and a
                    judge who incorporateshis idea of wise policy into the Constitution or into astatute and, as a
                    matter of fact, if you're familiar with the academiclegal debate, most of those writing in the law
                    schools these daysseem to prefer the latter kind of a judge, one who does not confinehimself to the
                    historical principles of the Constitution.</p>

                    limitation upon anti-abortionstatutes legitimately from the Constitution?"If after argument, that
                    didn't sound like it was going to be aviable theory, I would say to him, "I would like you to
                    arguewhether this is the kind of case that should not be overruled." Because,obviously, there are
                    cases we look back on and say they wereerroneous or they were not compatible with original intent,
                    but wedon't overrule them for a variety of reasons.A moment ago, in response to a question, I ran
                    through some ofthe factors. So I would listen to that argument.As I have said before, a judge with
                    an original intent philosophy,which goes back, by the way, to Marshall and Joseph Story, needsa
                    strong theory of precedent to keep from getting back into mattersthat are long settled, even if
                    incorrectly settled.</p>

                    that has voiced apprehensions similarto yours on this case, since you have been criticized by some
                    of mycolleagues as being outside of the mainstream, because of yourcriticisms of the so-called Roe
                    v. Wade case.For example, Gerald Gunther of the Stanford Law School citesRoe as an instance of the
                    "bad legacy of substantive due processand ends-oriented" judging.Professor Archibald Cox of Harvard
                    notes that the "court failedto establish the legitimacy of the decision by not articulating a
                    preceptof sufficient attractiveness to lift the ruling above the level ofa political judgment."By
                    the way, let's pause here. What do you suppose Archibald Coxmeant when he said that the decision was
                    not legitimate?</p>

                    along with Archibald Cox "It is not a constitutionalprinciple and the court has no business trying
                    to imposeit."Professor Bickel, who I think is respected by almost everybody,who is studied in the
                    law, also criticized the Roe decision for beinglegislation but not legal action. You're aware of
                    that. In fact, this isthe very point made by Justices White and Rehnquist. In fact, inlater
                    decisions, Justice O'Connor, the nation's first woman Justice,also criticized harshly the Roe
                    opinion.You could go on. Professor Forrester of Cornell calls the case"interventionist", and
                    Professor Kirland of Chicago calls it "a blatantusurpation".In your lengthy constitutional studies,
                    is there any SupremeCourt decision that has stirred more controversy or criticismamongst scholars
                    and citizens than that particular case?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That was a case in which the Navy discharged, honorably,I think it was a
                    petty officer for engaging in homosexualconduct in the barracks with a junior, subordinate. The Navy
                    has aregulation against homosexual conduct, not against the status ofhomosexuality, but against
                    homosexual conduct in the service.The discharged sailor sued, alleging, among other things, that
                    hehad a right of privacy to engage in homosexual conduct in theNavy, and that that flowed from
                    Griswold and Roe.Our panel of the court disagreed. We thought the right of privacywas relatively
                    undefined, but we saw no principle in the SupremeCourt's jurisprudence on the subject which would
                    lead us totell the Navy it could not ban that kind of conduct.Later the Supreme Court, in Bowers v.
                    Hardwick, upheld a muchmore severe regulation. After all, all we said was that the Navywas entitled
                    to discharge this fellow honorably. In Bowers v. Hardwick,they allowed the criminalizing of civilian
                    homosexual conduct,which is a much larger step than we took.</p>

                    the issue before we did, which seems to meto be always appropriate, because the legislature, when it
                    becomesaware of the problem, may make all kinds of adjustments and soforth to the problem, so that
                    it is not necessary for a judge to beginto apply the Constitution.I was convinced that Congress had
                    not faced that problem, so Iproposed to say that Pennsylvania domestic relations law
                    probablyinterfered with what was done, that that gave this fellow a right tosee his children, and
                    that Congress had not preempted Pennsylvaniadomestic relations law, had shown no desire to. I wanted
                    inthat way to send the case back so that the Congress would have todecide whether or not it wished
                    to preempt domestic relations lawand do what was, after all, a very drastic thing. That was my
                    positionin that case.Then, if Congress wanted to do it, we would have to face the
                    constitutionalissue.</p>

                    about. In fact, more thanPierce could be reached on acceptable grounds; Meyer v. Nebraska,which
                    invalidated a statute that prohibited the teaching of childrenin a foreign language, could also be
                    reached on an acceptableground.But what I was focusing on here is the court's reasoning, becausea
                    judge has no mandate to govern from any source other than hislogical demonstration that he got out
                    of the legal materials. If ajudge doesn't demonstrate that, then we're entitled to be unconvincedby

                <p class="short_transcript">That's coming across, I think, very well. I thinkfor those who have studied
                    your record and those who really do itfairly, they're going to conclude that you're testifying very
                    truthfullyhere, and I think accurately and honestly and very intelligently.Let me just end with
                    this. I was interested in Senator Kennedy'scomments about you and your writings and other lectures
                    aboutthe rights of women.Before heightened scrutiny was employed in the equal protectionanalysis,
                    the reasonable basis test that you advocated was used tostrike down gender discrimination. In other
                    words, the very testthat Senator Kennedy was criticizing, saying it was used to upholdgender
                    discrimination, was actually used to strike down gender discrimination.For example, in the Reed v.
                    Reed case, which struck down a lawthat preferred men over women in the appointment of
                    administratorsof the States, it's a perfect illustration where the reasonablebasis test that you
                    believe in was used to benefit women.Moreover, in the Claiborne case, your reasonable basis test
                    wasemployed to strike down discrimination against the retarded.</p>

                <strong>Orrin Hatch</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">And you're aware of that.In that case, Justice Stevens made the same point
                    you havemade today; that is, that the equal protection clause of the Constitutionof the United
                    States of America applies to everyone, not justselected people, not just one special class, or not
                    just one personover another. And I think your views harmonize with Justice Stevens,and I think they
                    surely indicate that you're in the mainstream.In every one of these cases—and I think the importance
                    of yourtestimony here today—it is not only that you're extremely intelligent,one of the great
                    judicial minds of our country, but that you'rein the mainstream. You have shown it through the
                    opinions thatyou've written, I think by the articles that you have written, thathave always had a
                    strong and good legal underpinning to them.You have shown it through indicating to the people of
                    Americatoday who are watching this on television that these cases are complex,they're not simple,
                    little bitty things, and there are usuallygood arguments on both sides of the case, and generally
                    compellingarguments, and you have to, as a judge, honestly make the best decisionsthat you can with
                    regard to each case.In every case in your 5 years on the Circuit Court of Appeals forthe District of
                    Columbia, the most important appellate court in thecountry except for the Supreme Court—and some
                    actually believeit may be more important because of the broad range of cases theSupreme Court never
                    sees that you do—that you have been in themajority an awful lot and you haven't been reversed, and
                    you havehad the Supreme Court adopt your actual language time aftertime.Now, I think that stands you
                    in good stead. I think it is time forthe American people to realize that what is involved here is
                    reallypolitics. Your opponents will try to show where you're an inadequatejudge, or that you're
                    unethical, or that you don't have ability,or your intellectual reasoning is not adequate or within
                    themainstream, they can't show it by your opinions or by your writings.What they have done, the
                    thing that I find really reprehensible,as I have looked at all these various groups out there who
                    are criticizingyou and have done it very selectively, they have been veryselective in the use of
                    their evidence, they have been selective inthe use of their statistics, they have been improper in
                    the use oftheir rhetoric, they have been inflammatory—If you look at thesefull-page ads, it makes
                    you wonder how anybody could supportsome of these organizations in coming up with that, I should
                    say,"clap trap" that really doesn't deserve to be injected into this typeof an important
                    nomination.I just want to say to you, I have watched you for many, manyyears. You and I differ on
                    the balanced budget amendment. Wediffer on the Constitutional Conventions Procedures bill, and
                    onwhether or not a convention can be limited to the single issue forwhich it's set up for. We differ
                    on the innercircuit tribunal and wediffer on diversity jurisdiction, and I am sure there are some
                    otherissues as well. But the point I'm saying is, it isn't important thatwe differ. What is
                    important is the type of person you are, the reputationthat you have, the intellect that is
                    compelling, and the reasonswhy people like Chief Justice Burger have given you the accoladesthat
                    they have, people who have sat there and people whoknow.What really appalls me is how some of these
                    law professorsacross this country have interjected some of these nuances into thisthat really don't
                    deserve to see the light of day. I am very disappointed.And what really has me outraged is the same
                    AmericanBar Association that found you unanimously exceptionally wellqualified back in 1981, just a
                    week ago had four of the 15 say thatyou're not qualified.</p>

                    tothink about tomorrow on how you would like to go about this, interms of the length of time. You're

                    to make it clear that I am prepared to go as long and expeditethis as rapidly as you would like. But
                    I also understand thereare limitations to anyone's ability to physically sit there that long.So I
                    will need some guidance from you as we go.I would like very much to move on. Possibly we could
                    finish withyou as a witness tomorrow. I don't know that. We have seven moreof my colleagues, which
                    will take us into mid-afternoon. Then therewill be a second round. But I would like you to be

                    between12:30 and 1 and recess until 2:30. I understand the Presidentmay be here until 2 or
                    thereabouts; I am not certain of that.If that is agreeable with my colleagues and with you,
                    Judge,somewhere after 12:30, before 1, we will stop, reconvene at 2:30,and make a judgment at that
                    time how late we will go today andwhether or not, Judge, it will be necessary for you to come
                    backtomorrow. Quite frankly, I think it probably will be. I do not thinkwe will finish today. You
                    and I have discussed it; if we can finishtoday without it going very late, we will try. If not, we
                    will comeback tomorrow.Does the ranking member have any comment he wishes tomake?</p>

                    Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.President Nixon first asked Attorney General Richardson to fireCox,

                    but you agreed to stayon and fire Mr. Cox.The regulation in effect when you fired Mr. Cox flatly
                    prohibitedfiring him unless he engaged in extraordinary improprieties, whichhe clearly did not. That
                    regulation had the force and effect of law.Under these circumstances, your firing of Mr. Cox was a

                    technicality, but the courtwhich reviewed the matter found that you "abolished the Office
                    ofWatergate Prosecutor on October 23rd and reinstated it less than 3weeks later under a virtually
                    identical regulation. It is clear," saidthe court, "that this turn-about was simply a ruse to permit
                    thedischarge of Mr. Cox. Defendant's order revoking the original regulationwas, therefore, arbitrary
                    and unreasonable and must be heldwithout force or effect."The court further said, "The Attorney
                    General chose to limit hisown authority by promulgating the Watergate Special Prosecutorregulation.
                    It is settled beyond dispute that under such circumstances,an agency regulation has the force and
                    effect of law and isbinding upon the body that issues it. The Supreme Court," said thecourt, "has
                    twice held that an executive department may not dischargeone of its own officers in a manner
                    inconsistent with itsown regulation concerning such discharge."Now, you say that they were wrong?

                <p class="short_transcript">In the first place, it should be noted that the onlyreason the amendment to
                    the regulation did not issue immediatelywas it was a Saturday night, Monday was a holiday,
                    ColumbusDay, and we could not get it published in the Federal Register.But in the second place, it
                    should be said—by the way, Mr. Coxdid not join in that lawsuit and did not seek back pay or to be
                    reinstated.The cases relied upon in Judge Gesell's opinion are all casesin which a department head
                    issued a regulation and then himselfdid something in contradiction to it. I thought, and still
                    think, thatthose cases do not apply to a case where a department head issuesa regulation and the
                    President orders him—the President gives anorder to abolish that regulation, which is, in effect,
                    what happened.No case cited by the court in that decision involves anything likethat.I should also
                    say that I appealed that case, and the moment I appealedit, the plaintiffs rushed in and said the
                    case is moot; that is,there is no longer a live controversy. I replied that the case wasmoot, there
                    was no live controversy when you filed it.However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
                    Circuitagreed that the case was no longer a live controversy and sentit back to the district court
                    with instructions to vacate the opinionand decision. Of course, as we know, the instructions to
                    vacatemean that the case no longer exists, in effect; the opinion no longerexists, in effect. Judge
                    Gesell did vacate his decision and opinion.</p>

                    of the Watergate Special ProsecutionForce, and the prosecutors resumed their grand jury sessions
                    asscheduled the following Tuesday. Bork placed Assistant AttorneyGeneral Henry Peterson, head of the
                    Criminal Division, in chargeof the investigations WSPF had been conducting." And here is acrucial

                    you fired Archibald Cox,you had a press conference on the Watergate matter. You said,"Until late
                    last Saturday afternoon, I was not involved in thesematters at all. I had upon two or three
                    occasions, I suppose, discussedjurisdictional problems concerning the Special ProsecutionForce with
                    Elliot Richardson and upon occasion, perhaps two occasions,with Archibald Cox and some of his staff.
                    But I did not knowthe details of what the jurisdictions were."The White House has also stressed that
                    you were not involved inthe Watergate matter prior to your firing Mr. Cox. The WhiteHouse submission
                    on your nomination states, "Prior to Saturdayevening, Bork had only been tangentially involved in
                    giving adviceto Elliot Richardson on the jurisdiction of the special prosecutor."In fact, Judge
                    Bork, a review of the record shows that you wereinvolved in giving advice to the White House on the
                    issue of executiveprivilege. I want to ask you about some documents, which atthis point, Mr.
                    Chairman, I ask be included in the record. Underyour rules, we will make them available during the
                    next break.</p>

                    executive privilege or government confidentiality,whatever we are going to call it, all of the time.
                    And, in fact, atone stage of this, Attorney General Elliot Richardson asked me totry to work out
                    with Mr. Philip Lacovara a common position on executiveprivilege so that the Watergate Special
                    Prosecution Force,which was trying to defeat executive privilege, and the Departmentof Justice,
                    which in all kinds of cases—not in the Watergate cases,but in all kinds of cases—was asserting
                    executive privilege. Mr. Lacovaraand I tried to work out some means in which we would notwind up
                    opposing each other, not directly, but wind up assertingopposing positions.Executive privilege was a
                    very touchy business, and I talked topeople about it frequently. Now, in this letter, I think I had
                    said tothe White House—I do not know what I said. I guess I had saidthat the strong stand on
                    executive privilege, which they asserted inall kinds of cases, was not going to work. My good
                    friend, CharlesBlack, who was a colleague of mine at Yale, sent me this letter andsaid he was
                    sending it to the New York Times. I think it appearedin the New York Times. And I passed it on.</p>

                    1973, attaching a column byProfessor Charles Black.In that column, Professor Black arguedthat, "Mr.
                    Nixon is dead right in refusing compliance with subpoenas,whether issued by a committee of the
                    Senate, by a grand jury,or by any other authority, commanding the production of writtenor taped
                    records of consultations held by him as President."In other words, he argued that President Nixon
                    could stonewallon the issue of turning over the tapes sought by the special prosecutor.Mr.
                    Buchanan's comment in the column was, "Maybe thisguy could help us out." General Haig's note back to
                    him said,"Right. Solicitor General thinks highly of him and supports thisanalysis."In other words,
                    Mr. Haig was relying on your endorsement ofProfessor Black and your reversal of your position that
                    the Presidenthad no obligation to turn over the tapes.</p>

                    inserted in the Congressional Record by CongressmanEckart of Texas. You say in your letter, "I think
                    you will find theseadditional ideas quite interesting."As in the previous case, "these ideas" you
                    were referring to hadto do with Professor Black's position that the President did nothave to respond
                    to a subpoena by anyone; in effect, that he had unlimitedexecutive privilege. General Haig then
                    passed on your submissionin a memo to the President dated August 8th. His memosaid, "Bob Bork has
                    sent me a copy of another letter written byCharles L. Black, Jr. I believe you will find it of
                    interest."As I see it, again, contrary to your statement that you were notinvolved, you were giving
                    your advice to the White House. And as Iunderstand the role of a Solicitor General, the Solicitor
                    General isthe attorney for the United States, not necessarily the privatecounsel to the President of

                    represented by the President.Let me make one thing clear, Senator Metzenbaum. I never advisedthe
                    White House how to meet, how to deal with the WatergateSpecial Prosecution Force. The most I did was
                    send overCharles Black's letter to the New York Times, which was public,and there was no business
                    about it. The only time I dealt with theWhite House on executive privilege was when Mr. Richardson
                    putme in charge of trying to mediate a position between the WhiteHouse and Department of Justice and
                    the Special ProsecutionForce. Since we represented the President in a lot of litigationhaving
                    nothing to do with Watergate, it was essential that we workout, if we could, some particular
                    position.I used to confer with Fred Buzhardt, the President's counsel, andwith Philip Lacovara. We
                    never achieved an accommodation inprinciple.</p>

                    Committee regarding the functionsof the new special prosecutor. After that hearing, SenatorKennedy
                    wrote you a letter dated November 16, 1973. He askedyou, "Prior to October 20, 1973, did you ever
                    discuss with the Presidentthe subject of executive privilege, the tapes, or Mr. Cox's
                    activities?Please provide details of any such conversations, date, subject,surrounding
                    circumstances, who said what to whom."You responded, "I have never discussed with the President
                    thesubjects of the tapes or Mr. Cox's activities either before or afterOctober 20, 1973. The
                    President discussed the subject of executiveprivilege with me on one occasion. Prof. Charles Black
                    of Yale LawSchool had written a letter to the New York Times upholding thePresident's right to
                    confidentiality. The President telephoned me toask that I tell Professor Black, whom he knew to be a
                    colleague,that the President agreed with his argument and admired the skillwith which he made it."
                    This is still you answering.</p>

                    forward a copy of a New York Times letter toGeneral Haig, and that General Haig gave it to President
                    Nixon,but I did not discuss executive privilege with the President. Hecalled me once to say he liked
                    Professor Black's letter. I think, if Ihave my dates correct—since the President did not call me
                    frequently—that I took that—I think. Now, I want to be careful becauseI am not sure of the dates.I
                    had been asked by General Haig right in that period of time toresign as Solicitor General and become
                    President Nixon's chief defensecounsel. After discussions, I convinced General Haig that Iwas not
                    the man for the job. And I think I interpreted the callfrom the President more as a gesture to say
                    he did not hold itagainst me, because there was nothing to the call and he would notordinarily have
                    called.</p>

                    you said it. I will not take issuewith you.The report in the Washington Post of October 24th stated,
                    "Peterson"—who was then head of the Criminal Division at Justice—"and Bork met yesterday afternoon
                    with senior staff members ofCox's prosecuting office to discuss how the investigation will
                    proceed.'The independence of the prosecution is still a problem,' oneof the senior Cox staff members
                    who attended the meeting said lastnight. Peterson said that no one has come to any firm
                    conclusionabout the hiring of another independent prosecutor. The last fewdays have brought that
                    concept into question."The White House submission on your behalf contains this statement:After
                    carrying out the President's instruction to dischargeCox, Bork acted immediately to safeguard the
                    Watergate investigationand its independence. He promptly established a new specialprosecutor's
                    office, giving it authority to pursue the investigationwithout interference. And according to a
                    published report, you toldthe American Bar Association in 1982, when you were being consideredfor an
                    appointment to the Federal Court of Appeals, thatafter Cox was fired you "immediately began
                    searching for anotherspecial prosecutor."As a matter of fact, you actually ordered that the Justice
                    Departmentitself take over the investigation, as I think you have just indicated,and the decision to
                    appoint a new special prosecutor wasmade by the President several days later only after
                    widespreadpublic criticism. Is that not correct?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, it is entirely correct, but let me tell youhow that happened.On
                    Wednesday afternoon, when I held the press conference andsaid, in response to a specific question
                    about whether a specialprosecutor was one of the mechanisms I had in mind to get evidence,I said,
                    "It has, let us say, crossed my mind." That morning Iwas not telling the press everything that we
                    discussed. I think youhave documents in your possession that show that that morningbefore the press
                    conference I met at the White House with LeonardGarment, Fred Buzhardt and Bryce Harlow. We
                    recommended tothe President a new special prosecutor.So that was on track. I hadclearly been
                    thinking about it before Wednesday morning, or Iwould not have gone over there and made the
                    recommendation.But there were two other aspects in which you used, Senator, theword "immediately." I
                    did promptly act to safeguard the SpecialProsecution Force. My great concern was that there might be
                    a lotof resignations over there which would hinder the investigationsand prosecutions.I understood
                    from the beginning that my moral and professionallife were on the line if something happened to
                    those investigationsand prosecutions, and that is why I was adamant in asking them tostay—and Henry
                    Peterson was, too.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">AS I said, my involvement with the Special ProsecutionForce and Mr. Cox was
                    limited to trying to draft, at the requestof Mr. Richardson, a redefinition of the jurisdiction
                    becausethe feeling was that the jurisdiction was stated so broadly that itcovered things in no way
                    related to Watergate. I did draft it; wediscussed it with Mr. Cox. We never came to an agreement,
                    and allthis other stuff happened.I also dealt with the Special Prosecution Force through Mr.
                    Lacovaraat Mr. Richardson's request on the question of accommodatingour positions on executive
                    privilege. I had no connection with thenegotiations with Mr. Cox about the order not to go to court
                    and soforth and so on. I wish I had because I could have said, if I hadbeen involved, what are you
                    going to do if Mr. Cox refuses theorder—as, indeed, he should have. I had never disputed that.If
                    they had asked themselves that question, they might haveasked: Who is going to discharge Mr. Cox?
                    And if they had learnedthat Mr. Richardson and Mr. Ruckelshaus were not going to do it,they never
                    would have gone forward with that order. They werevery sick that night because they assumed that
                    they would nothave to get down to me.Now, I was sitting in my office Saturday afternoon writing
                    aletter, I think to a third grade class about the Bill of Rights, and Iwent down at the time
                    scheduled for Mr. Cox's press conferenceinto the office of Jack Hushin, who was our press officer
                    then. Wewatched it on television. The minute it was over, Mr. Richardson'ssecretary came in the door
                    and said, "The Attorney General wantsto see you."We went in then, into his office, and Mr.
                    Ruckelshaus was thereand a few of Mr. Richardson's aides, and we talked about this crisisthat was
                    developing. Finally, Mr. Richardson said something like,"I think they are going to order me to fire
                    him," or "They haveordered me, or "I think they are going to order me." He said, "Icannot fire Cox.
                    Can you, Bill?" And that was the first time it occurredto me that I was third in command at the
                    Department ofJustice.I suddenly saw it.</p>

                    unless you think the assurance was somethinglike a statute, which the Senate, of course, could not
                    pass byitself.Now, Richardson regarded them as personal assurances, and Iwill tell you why. I am
                    skipping over now, but I would like to comeback to this.Later in the afternoon, Richardson went over
                    to the WhiteHouse. They attempted to persuade him to go ahead. He attemptedto tell him he could not.
                    While he was gone, Bill Ruckelshaus and Idiscussed what might happen in the outcome. And I realized,
                    becauseof a conversation we just skipped, I realized I would probablybe facing this thing. I never
                    asked Ruckelshaus what I should do. Idid say to him at one point, "Don't you think my moral position
                    isdifferent from yours?" He said yes. That is all I asked him.But let me go back to the conversation

                <p class="short_transcript">I had not made—as I understand, Mr. Ruckelshausfelt that there was something
                    in his confirmation hearings thattended to bear on this; there was none in mine because I was
                    confirmedlong before. He also regarded himself as having come in asElliot Richardson's deputy, so
                    that he felt himself bound in a senseby Elliot Richardson's promises. I did not come in as Elliot
                    Richardson'sman, and I had made no assurances to the Senate.But let me go on with this story. He
                    said, "Can you do it, Bill?"And Bill said no. That is the first time I realized I was going to
                    beasked the question. And he said, "Can you do it, Bob?" The thoughthad never occurred to me before,
                    and it hit me like a ton of bricks.So I said, "Let me think." And they went on talking, and I got
                    upand walked around Elliot's office several times. I finally said, "Yes,I can do it, but I will
                    resign immediately afterwards." And theysaid, "Why would you resign?" And I replied, "Because I do
                    notwant to be regarded as an apparatchik," an organization man whodoes whatever the organization
                    wants.They said, "If you do do it," both of them said, "don't resign. Thedepartment needs the
                    continuity and the stability." That is whenthe thought about the necessity of holding the department
                    togetherfirst came into my mind, and Elliot and Bill were both quite strongon the point that, if you
                    do do it, do not leave because the departmentneeds this continuity. And I was the one person who was
                    adepartment-wide officer who was left and who could make a goodattempt at both preserving the
                    Department of Justice and preservingthe Watergate Special Prosecution Force, which was obviouslythe
                    thing that had to be done in both cases.</p>

                    governmentalcrisis which would not be resolved until Mr. Cox left. At no timedid I have any
                    intention of anybody but Mr. Cox leaving, and I hadnothing against Mr. Cox. Mr. Cox had behaved
                    perfectly properly.Had I been in his position, I would have refused that order not togo to court. He
                    had to refuse it.But that was the crux of a crisis which had to be resolved sooneror later. Now, the
                    White House, when they got to me, began talkingabout the Six-Day War going on.</p>

                    given access to every record andwaived every possibility to withhold anything, and that is a
                    veryappropriate stand.But I want to touch on one thing that the Senator from Ohiosaid yesterday and
                    again today about the use of the word "illegal".It is very sinister as it is presented that the
                    decision to file ArchibaldCox was held to be illegal by a court, and should we then puta man on the
                    Supreme Court of the United States who has donesomething illegal? And that is the sinister
                    connotation of all ofthat stuff, along with the reference to the case of Nader v. Bork,and it was
                    highly significant and it does not get said here—I wantto say it one more time because there is no
                    such thing in politics asrepetition. You can tell somebody the same thing ten times and onthe tenth
                    time they say, "Oh, I did not know you believed that."I have been all through that. This case of
                    Nader v. Bork was vacated,period. You know, void, out the window, we all practicedlaw, some of us.
                    We know what vacating a decision is. It means itis a zip, an absolute zip, in any kind of language
                    you want to use,whether it is Black's Law Dictionary or the babblings of Al Simpson,it is a zip; it
                    means nothing.They vacated the decision upon the order of the court of appealsand the case has no
                    legal consequence whatsoever, period. Wouldyou agree with that?</p>

                    wouldfollow. So, you know, it is a question of timing. But I think it wasnot even a technical

                    wanted to ask a question—you are helping me, Orrin; youare furnishing me all sorts of good things.
                    What have you got here?This is an impossible question.I ask you this: We now have heard from the
                    Senator of Ohio, andhe is superb. He and I have been on the opposite side of moreissues, but he is a
                    remarkable spirited man, and he has been agreat help to me in conference committees. If you want to
                    go to aconference committee, take Metzenbaum with you. He is good stuff.But he has asked you, and he
                    has gone into the 1973 press conference,which I guess was the 23d or 24th</p>

                    Question: Will the SpecialProsecution staff stay together as an entity? Will the head beunder Mr.
                    Peterson, and who will that head be? That is the questionfor Acting Attorney General Bork.Answer:
                    "Well, right now, and so far as I am concerned, thathead is Mr. Ruth. They will stay together as an
                    entity because Ithink their effectiveness demands upon that." That is what yousaid. There were other
                    questions.And then you said at the end, "I recognize, as does Mr. Peterson"—this is your quote—"that
                    the American public must perceivethat the integrity of the Department of Justice and of the
                    criminalprocess is unimpaired, as well as our assuring you that that is true,and we have under
                    consideration a variety of procedures or mechanismsby which that perception may be encouraged or may
                    bemade. The trust may be given to us."The question then: "Mr. Bork, what are those?" Your
                    response:"I am not going to discuss the variety of procedures we have underconsideration." I would
                    like to have, you know, like Paul Harveysays, the rest of the story in there. I think that would be
                    honestand appropriate. And then, of course, the proof is in what happened,an operation that so
                    irritated and overwhelmed the Presidentthat it must have been working pretty appropriately. I
                    meanthat is what happened.Now enough of that. I just was thinking, what if the fondestdreams of your
                    opponents come true and that you are not confirmedby the Senate, what then can they expect? Well, I
                    think obviouslywe will have an appointment by this President. There isnobody that is going to
                    question that, and then we will probablyhave a nominee who we will probably confirm almost
                    routinely,such as a member of the Judiciary Committee, Orrin Hatch orPaul Laxalt.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Yes, not bad to any of us. I do not think any ofus on the panel would spend
                    too great a time putting them rightthere in the witness seat. But if that were not the case, that
                    wouldsplendid. It might be Jerome P. Sturdley, a person who has quiteextensive experience on the
                    bench and in the Bar, one that hassaid very little or has written very little, that it was
                    eitherthoughtful, challenging or provocative or perhaps one whom thespecial interest would have a
                    great deal of difficulty finding outone wit about for use in their opposition to the Presidential
                    appointment,and that is, you know, the reason we are here.But most likely he or she would obviously
                    be one who would declineto do anything of what you are doing. They would not enterin any way into
                    the exceptional discussion, the give and take, thereview of judicial views and philosophy which we
                    have seen thesepast 2 days. You are doing it and will do it, which is really unprecedentedeven for
                    your immediate predecessors, Sandra Day O'Connor,Antonin Scalia and Bill Rehnquist. I think they
                    ought to soberup and realize they could get another nominee who would saynothing and tell them
                    nothing and share nothing.And I think that is worth, you know, considering because I thinkthe whole
                    text of a new confirmation would be "Senator, I understandyour position; I know what you would like
                    me to say, but Ihonestly feel, sir, that I must adhere to my view. It would be improperfor me as a
                    sitting justice or a nominee or a person dealingwith that issue in the future to advance an answer
                    to that question.Next question please."Now that is what you are going to get in the next load in
                    thissituation. I just think that after looking at some of the responses ofJudges Scalia and Sandra
                    Day O'Connor, and they were perfectlyappropriate and no one challenged them a bit, nor could we in
                    anew nominee. And you are good enough to lay yourself right out onthe table.But, you know, the
                    questions are there. They said "I cannot respondto that." That was interesting. They were very
                    adroit andvery upfront and very acceptable, and we all accepted it, we on thecommittee. And that is
                    what is a little bit of reality too.Then I think also of our friends in the fourth estate, as it
                    getsscratching down through the record of every person who has sat onthe federal bench at least in
                    the last 10 years, I know of no one, noone who has protected first amendment rights more than you.
                    Thatis an extraordinary statement, but it is true.To you New York Times v. Sullivan is milk soup.
                    You are readyto go for the chunk. And New York Times y. Sullivan was an interestingcase. It said
                    that because we are politicians, people could saythings about us that were, quote, "false". People
                    could say thingsabout us that were defamatory, those were the words, and that wecould do nothing
                    unless we proved actual malice.Your language in the Oilman case was quite open, and I do nothave it
                    here before me at this moment, but, in other words, you sayanybody—I guess it is kind of like anyone
                    goofy to run for office isdumb enough to get elected or something like that. But it was saidthat we
                    are indeed, and we should be, fair game. We better be ableto tell our story, bring our own brains
                    with us when we come. Thatis what the people expect of us.But you would take that much further,
                    would you not?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I think that it is worthwhile to recognize whatan extraordinary ally and
                    force you are. One of the quotes fromthat case was you said, as you were sticking with the decision,
                    thefact that this was an expression of opinion. You said it is the kindof hyperbole that must be
                    accepted in the rough and tumble of politicalargument. And I agree with that.And that is one thing
                    the Senator from Ohio and I have alwaysagreed on. It is a rough and tumble but you can do it with
                    civilityand we try to do that.Let us get back to privacy. That is a recurring theme here
                    aboutprivacy and judicial restraint and Griswold v. Connecticut, and wehave now talked about
                    contraception, homosexuality, sterility orelse sexual preference, sexual gratification. There is no
                    tellingwhere we will get if we keep struggling along in this area. Thoseare important things. I do
                    not even belittle that. But it has all beentaken out of context, every bit of it.I do not think you
                    had an appropriate time to respond on theissue of privacy, and especially with regard to the
                    Griswold caseand the Skinner case. I guess I want to be sure because there was aline of questioning
                    which I gathered—and I think it was our Chairman,and it was a good line of questioning—it was, well
                    if you donot embrace these things through some method, how are we goingto get to that point? How do
                    you protect?I want to ask you if it is fair to say that you believe that privacyis protected under
                    the Constitution, but that you just do not believethat there is a general and unspecified right that
                    protects everythingincluding homosexual conduct, incest, whatever—and youmentioned that yesterday.
                    Is that correct?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That is correct, Senator. I think the fact that I didnot get everything I
                    wanted to say out was my fault because I wastrying to discuss with Senator Biden and others the
                    constitutionalproblem. But I think it requires a fuller answer than that and thatis this: No
                    civilized person wants to live in a society without a lotof privacy in it. And the framers, in fact,
                    of the Constitution protectedprivacy in a variety of ways.The first amendment protects free exercise
                    of religion. The freespeech provision of the first amendment has been held to protectthe privacy of
                    membership lists and a person's associations in orderto make the free speech right effective. The
                    fourth amendment protectsthe individual's home and office from unreasonable searchesand seizures,
                    and usually requires a warrant. The fifth amendmenthas a right against self-incrimination.There is
                    much more. There is a lot of privacy in the Constitution.Griswold, in which we were talking about a
                    Connecticut statutewhich was unenforced against any individual except the birth controlclinic,
                    Griswold involved a Connecticut statute which bannedthe use of contraceptives. And Justice Douglas
                    entered that opinionwith a rather eloquent statement of how awful it would be to havethe police
                    pounding into the marital bedroom. And it would beawful, and it would never happen because there is
                    the fourthamendment.Nobody ever tried to enforce that statute, but the police simplycould not get
                    into the bedroom without a warrant, and what magistrateis going to give the police a warrant to go
                    in to search forsigns of the use of contraceptives? I mean it is a wholly bizarre andimaginary
                    case.Now let me say this</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I want to say that you really could not enforce thatthing, and the privacy
                    was not the issue in that case. It was the useof contraceptives, and it is a little hard to locate
                    something aboutcontraceptives in the Constitution.But be that as it may, let me illustrate my
                    objection to what isgeneralized right of privacy.Suppose a Senator introduced a billwhich said every
                    man and woman and child in this country has aright of privacy, period. I do not think that bill
                    would go anywhereuntil he had to tell everybody exactly what the right of privacyprotected. Did it
                    protect incest? Did it protect beating your wife inprivate? Did it protect price-fixing in
                    private?No Congress would ever pass a bill like here, here is a generalizedright of privacy; make of
                    it what you will. No court woulduphold such a statute because it would be void for vagueness.Now the
                    Supreme Court or Justice Douglas in effect did thesame thing with the Constitution. Nobody knows
                    what that thingmeans. But you have to define it; you have to define it. And thecourt has not given
                    it definition. That is my only point.Now the only reason that Connecticut statute stayed on the
                    statutebook—it was an old, old statute, dating back from the dayswhen Connecticut was entirely a
                    Yankee State—the only reason itstayed on the statute book was that it was not enforced. If
                    anybodyhad tried to enforce that against a married couple, he would havebeen out of office instantly
                    and the law would have been repealed.Furthermore, if the prosecutor brought such a case, I do
                    notthink any court would uphold a conviction, assuming that youcould get a conviction. That law had
                    not been enforced for solong—it is an utterly antique statute; I do not think it was everenforced—I
                    think you would have a great argument of no fairwarning, or sometimes that lawyers call—and I hate
                    to use a wordlike this—desuetude, meaning it is just so out of date it has goneinto limbo.So no
                    prosecutor is going to bring that prosecution. If he did, thelaw would disappear and furthermore no
                    court would uphold theprosecution. That is the fact. That law never went anywhere. Myobjection—I
                    think the law was an utterly silly law, but my objectionis simply to the undefined nature of what
                    the court did there.And I have tried to illustrate that for you by asking you whetheryou would vote
                    for a statute that said nothing more than that ev243erybody has a right of privacy, and the court
                    shall enforce it. I donot think you would.</p>

                    arrested,and the only person who could get arrested was a doctor who advertisedthat he was giving
                    birth control information, contraceptiveinformation, and I do not know if they prosecuted him or
                    fined himunder the aiding and abetting clause of the Code, and I think bothsides regarded it as an
                    interesting test case. The whole case waspractically an academic exercise.</p>

                    article about Skinner v. Oklahoma was thatthe classification distinction made by the court could not

                    usually cannot when it is crucial.I really would not buy the way the Supreme Court there wentabout
                    it, but I think it is clear—people who have looked at it morethan I have say it is clear that that
                    statute had racial animus in it,and it struck at, in effect, crimes that at that time were
                    morelikely to be committed by poor blacks than by middle-class whitecollarwhites. And on that ground
                    the statute would be unconstitutional.</p>

                    entered in the record—and I will concludemy round, and you have been courteous—but it seems to meso
                    far that the extremism so far in this case and the extremistviews and the philosophy of Judge Bork,
                    that the extremism is inthe rhetoric of the opponents of Judge Bork. That is where it is tothis
                    point, and the stridency of that.I am not talking about the panel. I am talking about newspaperads
                    and all this stuff, and television ads, and we have and willhave an opportunity to pursue this to
                    find that we have a, quote,"conservative judge" who exercises judicial restraint, who tries toleave
                    social policy decisions to the people and their elected representativeswhere the Constitution does
                    not clearly speak, you arethat sort of judge.And I want to enter into the record, Mr. Chairman, a
                    thoughtfulpiece in this morning's Washington Post of Lloyd Cutler, counselemeritus, as I call him,
                    to Presidents, with a case-by-case illustra246tion that Judge Bork's criticisms of the Supreme Court
                    decisionswhich we have been discussing for the past two days were in themain shared by the, quote,
                    "moderate members of our contemporarySupreme Court".And I can tell you, do not think what Lloyd
                    Cutler has done hasnot been provocative for him, because it is so good and so pungentand so
                    authentic, what he has been saying, that they have nowtried to drum him out of the corps. And that
                    is why he has alwaysbeen a superb man and will always be.So I would like that statement, "Judge Bork
                    is called JudgeBork, well within the mainstream", unquote, be part of the hearingrecord. And I thank
                    you very much.</p>

                    there on the enforceability or non-enforceabilityof the statute in Connecticut vis-a-vis the
                    Griswold decision.In the Bowers v. Hardwick, Georgia case, dealing with sodomy,that is an old
                    statute that was on the books. I do not know. I believethat it was 60 years or more that it had ever
                    been in force,but in fact somebody enforced that statute, did they not?</p>

                    with me. Imean that is a legitimate mode of constitutional analysis.I do not think you can use the
                    ninth amendment unless youknow something of what it means. For example, if you had anamendment that
                    says "Congress shall make no" and then there isan ink blot and you cannot read the rest of it and
                    that is the onlycopy you have, I do not think the court can make up what mightbe under the ink blot

                    of these does not entitle judges to overridethe state constitutional rights. They also might have
                    had inmind perhaps a fixed category of what they regarded as naturalrights, although if they did
                    have in mind a category of naturalrights, I am a little surprised they did not spell it out and put
                    itinto the Constitution, because they specified all the other rights.There is no evidence that I
                    know of that this was to be a dynamiccategory of rights, that is that under the ninth amendment
                    thecourt was free to make up more Bill of Rights. There is no evidenceof that at all that I know of.
                    And I think that had that been theirobjective, they could have spelled it out a lot better, and a
                    lot ofthe constitutional debates we had right after the Constitution wasformed, and John Marshall
                    began applying the Constitution and soforth, would have been irrelevant debates because the court is
                    justentitled to make up constitutional rights.</p>

                    standards,moral or aesthetic, and if you prove stubborn about adopting myview of the situation, I am
                    justified in having the State coerce youinto more righteous paths. That is what I said was the
                    principle ofunsurpassed ugliness. It was the principle I thought was underlyingthis thing, which was
                    a principle that can apply much morebroadly.</p>

                    and Fortune called me—I had written forthem before—and asked me to write something about the
                    SupremeCourt. And I wrote about two models of how the Supreme Courtmight go about its work. And one
                    model was to take the lead ofGriswold, only instead of calling it privacy, call it freedom, whichit
                    is, and construct the philosophy that lines up a more generalprinciple of freedom that the
                    individual amendments are simply illustrationsof.That sounded like a great idea to me then, and when
                    I cameback from London after a sabbatical year, that is when I talked, ofcourse, with Alex Bickel
                    and found the course going flat, and Isaid, "What is wrong with this course? Why are not the
                    studentsexcited?" And he said, "You are not saying those crazy things anymore",by which he meant
                    those crazy libertarian things I used tosay. And that is when I first realized I was moving away.And
                    by 1971 I had abandoned this attempt and said you have gotto go to the intents of the people who
                    made the Constitution.</p>

                    dissent of Justice Harlan joined by JusticeStewart in Katzenbach v. Morgan. And the reason I agreed
                    withthe dissent was that the majority said that Congress by statutecould change a rule the Supreme
                    Court had laid down. The SupremeCourt had held that non-discriminatory literacy tests
                    wereconstitutional. Congress passed a statute which in certain circumstancessays they are outlawed.
                    And the Court said the Congresscan define the equal protection clause in some ways.I thought that
                    was bad constitutional law. I do not think Congresscan change the Constitution, which is precisely
                    why I testifiedagainst the Human Rights Bill, which would have changed Roev. Wade by statute. And I
                    certainly have never endorsed</p>

                    not precise? If theplain language of the amendment requires States to equally protectall within its

                    the Congress whenthose words are as precise as this person can read them?And I am not a student of
                    the Constitution or pretend to be alaw professional of constitutional law. The amendment does not
                    saythat the State cannot enact laws that discriminate. It says it mustequally protect any person.
                    Does this not mean that a State mustenact laws to protect equally all persons? Is that not the rest

                <p class="short_transcript">I was just telling you it is in the Cleburne case. Thehistorical meaning,
                    the core idea, the trouble that caused the 14thamendment to be adopted was the fear of and the
                    reality of racialdiscrimination against former slaves in this country, so ;tnat everytime a court
                    reasons about the 14th amendment, it usually startswith the paradigm case of racial discrimination.I
                    objected to when the Supreme Court was using a method ofsaying this group, illegitimate children,
                    aliens is in; this group,somebody else, is out. That seemed to me to be a very funny way toproceed.
                    It is much better to proceed—because we have no evidencethat any of those groups were meant to be in
                    or out. It is muchbetter to proceed under the reasonableness test, which the thingaf sr all says,
                    "nor shall any State deny to any person the equalprotection of the laws". Any person is covered.
                    That means everybodyis covered, men, women, everybody.And the question, when a statute makes a
                    distinction is whetherthe State has an adequate interest in it and the distinction is reasonable.Now
                    in a racial case it will almost never be reasonable.</p>

                    quoted saying that "The role that menand women should play in society is a highly complex business,
                    andit changes as our culture changes. What I am saying (10 years ago)was that it was shift in
                    constitutional methods of government tohave judges deciding all of those enormously sensitive,
                    highly political,highly cultural issues", end of quote. That was June 1, 1966,the Judicial
                    Notice.Now what troubles me, Judge, is why are the questions concerningsex discrimination any more
                    difficult or any more complex andundeserving of constitutional, judicial resolution than other
                    questionsroutinely subject to the court constitutional analysis, questionssuch as the discrimination
                    on the basis of race that we havediscussed here? It leaves me with a big void here that—and I
                    knowthat you have tried to explain it and I have paid attention yesterday,but I did not get it.</p>

                    would have to write the complete body ofwhat is allowable, discrimination or whatever it is.A
                    reasonable basis test allows a little more play in the joints, Ithink, for the court to listen to
                    the legislatures and look at the societyand bring evidence in and so forth. If you want to say that
                    theEqual Rights Amendment really would enact the same thing as thereasonable basis test, then my

                    prohibit in the law as to race, not all of thosewould be prohibited as to gender. Now, for example,
                    you could nothave a national law that said only blacks or only whites will gointo combat. It may
                    be—and I do not want to arouse a philosophicalargument here, but it certainly seems likely to me
                    that youcould have a national law—in fact, the Supreme Court has said asmuch—saying that only males
                    will go into combat, and, you know,there was a case about whether you could have an all-male
                    draft,and the Supreme Court said you could.So that is an illustration of the fact that gender in
                    some cases istreated differently from race.</p>

                    protection of women broader than thosethat the Supreme Court would accept.The other fact is that in
                    the gender cases that I have decided asa Court of Appeals judge, I have decided more of them in

                    answering questions. It is a breath of freshair to have somebody like you before us who is willing
                    to answerthese questions. You are the fourth Supreme Court nominee that Ihave had the opportunity to
                    evaluate. I want to express my appreciationfor the depth to which you are willing to go in
                    respondingto our questions.This gets me to my initial questions regarding your views. Thesemay not
                    seem appropriate, compared to the questions you havebeen asked. But you know that there has been a
                    debate raging overthe past 2 months over the Senate's advise and consent role. Allthe committee
                    members have weighed in with their views on whatour proper role is. This may be an uncomfortable
                    question, but,given your preeminence as an interpreter of the Constitution and,because as a judge,
                    you must decide between two views all thetime, I am wondering if I can hear your view on what
                    article II,section 3 of the Constitution means.</p>

                    thatyou can judge a candidate's judicial philosophy. But I think itwould be quite wrong to say,
                    "Well, I agree with him but there isone crucial case that he might decide the wrong way and

                    as—that is, I used to think if there was a transitionperiod as we brought a certain racial group
                    into the mainstreamof American life, using race as a criterion might be allright. But what I was
                    afraid of as a policy matter was that thepreferences would never go away and it would become a
                    permanentfeature of American life, causing a lot of resentments andcausing other groups to demand
                    the same preferences.But I have never really written about the subject at length.</p>

                    quotas. I would like to quote from ProfessorBickel's. "Morality of Consent" at Page 133, and I
                    quote:"The lesson of the great decisions of the Supreme Court and thelesson of contemporary history
                    have been the same for at least ageneration. Discrimination on the basis of race is illegal,
                    immoral,unconstitutional, inherently wrong, and destructive of democraticsociety." Now, this is to
                    be unlearned, and we are told that this isnot a matter of fundamental principle but only a matter of
                    whoseox is being gored.Continuing to quote, "Those for whom racial equality was demandedare to be
                    more equal than others. Having found support inthe Constitution for equality, they now claim support
                    for inequalityunder the same Constitution."Do you share these views?</p>

                    conservativeabout people who decry it. The centuries old tradition of thecommon law is that law is

                <p class="short_transcript">That is not a reason for making up a new Constitution,no. There is no clause
                    in the Constitution that says the legislaturesshall make no dumb law.Senator GRASSLEY, I want to now
                    ask you about another issuethat has been brought before us. Do you change your mind toomuch, or do
                    you have the ability to change your mind at all? Ofcourse, judges are not robots. They have the
                    ability to rethink theirviews over time and change their minds. From that standpoint, obviously,they
                    are similar to Senators because we change our mindsall the time.So I want to focus on your ability
                    to change your mind on importantissues. One example I am aware of is your position on thepublic
                    accommodations provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Ithink Senator Simpson yesterday reminded us
                    that there are threemembers of the Senate who voted against that Act and now havechanged their minds
                    about it as well.What other legal issues can you identify for me where you haverethought your views
                    and have publicly come to different conclusions?Well, in 1968, as I mentioned, I endorsed a
                    versionof lawmaking under the Constitution by the Supreme Court. In1971, I had become convinced that
                    I was quite wrong, and I publishedthe Indiana article, the main thrust of which was that I takeback
                    what I said in "Fortune"; that is wrong, and I will tell youwhy it is wrong. And I did.In the second
                    half of the Indiana article, I said, admittedly as aspeculative, tentative view—and I explained why
                    I took that position—that maybe the Constitution protected only explicitly politicalspeech. I have
                    explained why I have decided that was wrong.Indeed, more than wrong; it was an example of a
                    professor doingwhat legislatures sometimes do—being dumb. It was a dumb idea. Ipublished it. I have
                    dropped that.</p>

                    passage of time by itself is not important. Theonly reason it is important is that if expectations
                    and institutionsand laws and so forth have grown up around the decision in thatpassage of time. That
                    certainly weighs in favor of not overrulingthe decision. In a very short period of time, obviously,
                    things areunlikely to have occurred.On the other hand, the Court, I think, tends to lose confidence
                    ifit starts overruling cases that it decided 6 months or 1 year agojust because the personnel is
                    changed. It is a complex question ofwhen to overrule, and I do not know that I have a philosophy.
                    Iknow that I do not. I know the factors I would consider, some ofthem. I have never read a theory of
                    when to overrule and when notto overrule a precedent that had any firmness to it. People just
                    discussvarious factors.</p>

                    In Griswold, Justice Black, in dissent, wrote that the ninthamendment was passed to assure the
                    people that the Constitutionwas intended to limit the federal government to the powers
                    expresslygranted to it, or by implication necessary for it to operate.Yesterday, Senator Thurmond
                    asked you about the purpose of theninth amendment.Let me ask you this: In more than 150 years
                    between enactmentof the ninth amendment and the Griswold case, had the SupremeCourt ever used the
                    ninth amendment as a weapon of federalpower to prevent State legislatures from passing laws they
                    considerednecessary?</p>

                    force, just as they have not found the10th amendment to have much force.</p>

                    everybody is going to agree that that is a worthy amendment.However, what was intended to act as an
                    obstacle to expandedfederal authority has become, in the words of the SupremeCourt, only a

                    when I was discussing the fact that the commerceclause is expanded in ways that it is simply too
                    late for ajudge to go back and tear up.I think the framers and the ratifiershad a rather clear idea
                    that these powers were limited and hadkind of clear contours to them. Indeed, the Government
                    operatedthat way for a while, for a long while.But the fact is, beginning with the Civil War up
                    through theNew Deal, the idea that those powers were limited and not reallynational in scope got
                    lost. Now, we are operating in a fashion inwhich the 10th amendment, I am sorry to say, has almost
                    no practicalsignificance, and I do not really see how it can much, givenwhat has happened to the way
                    the Nation has grown.</p>

                    you were attending the celebrationof the Constitution. If you were not, I hope you had acooler place
                    to spend the noon hour than those who were out there.Judge Bork, I am interested not so much in one
                    specific case, butjust how your own thinking has evolved over the years and whatwe might anticipate,
                    knowing that there are no ironclad guaranteeswhen any judge goes on the bench, nor should there be.
                    ButSenator Simpson had said earlier this morning that you are in adifferent position than if a
                    totally unknown person were to comehere who had never written on anything or anything else. Andthat
                    is true. You are one of the most prolific writers I have everseen. And having spent a good part of
                    the month of August in Vermontreading your writings, there were days that I wished you hadperhaps
                    not been so prolific, and perhaps days that you wish thesame.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I am sure you do.But I would hope that no President would send up somebody
                    whois a total tabula rasa. I would not want any President to show whatwould be almost disdain for
                    the Supreme Court to nominate anyman or woman, no matter how brilliant, who had no views ever
                    expressedin the law. So I think it is good for us and for the countrythat if the President is going
                    to send a name up, he sends somebodywith a large body of writings behind him in the field that
                    hewill be deciding.Let me first go over a few things. You said yesterday, in effect,that you believe
                    that there is not a constitutional underpinning tothe Supreme Court's opinion striking down a ban on
                    contraception.You said yesterday that there is no constitutional underpinning tothe Supreme Court's
                    opinion striking down racially restrictive covenants,and that there is no constitutional
                    underpinning to the SupremeCourt's opinion upholding the principle of one person, onevote. In fact,
                    you set forth all those views in your Indiana LawJournal article.So I would like to ask you, now
                    that we have talked about yourviews on those three areas, your views on the Supreme Court's
                    decisionsin another area—in fact, the main focus of your article, thearea of freedom of speech. I
                    would like to take as my startingpoint—and I would like to see the evolution, if there is one, of
                    yourviews in this area—the starting point the 1971 Indiana Law Reviewwhich you entitled "Neutral
                    Principles and Some First AmendmentProblems."I am using that for a number of reasons. First, the
                    article is wellwritten; its arguments are clearly stated. Whether one agrees ornot with the
                    arguments, we know specifically what they are. Ithink this is probably cited more often in Law
                    Reviews and bycourts than any of the rest of your articles. In fact, I think it is sortof in the top
                    10 or 12 of the articles most cited by any author ofLaw Review articles.I understand it represents
                    the most comprehensive statement ofyour philosophy of the Constitution. Am I correct on those
                    pointsso far?</p>

                    Senate, but certainly the country, and yourfeelings there, if you were to go on the Supreme
                    Court.Let us start with the first amendment and the right of freespeech mentioned in the Indiana
                    article. On Page 20 you say, "Constitutionalprotection should be accorded only to speech that is
                    explicitlypolitical. There is no basis for judicial intervention to protectany other form of
                    expression, be it scientific, literary, or thatvariety of expression we call obscene or
                    pornographic. Moreover,within that category of speech we ordinarily call political, thereshould be
                    no constitutional obstruction to laws making criminalany speech that advocates forcible overthrow of
                    the Government orthe violation of the law." That is basically an accurate statement ofwhat you have

                    and Senator Tunney, then of California,read to you an extract from that article in which you
                    said,"Explicitly political speech does not cover scientific, educational,commercial or literary
                    expressions as such. A novel may haveimpact upon attitudes that affects politics, but it would not
                    for thatreason receive judicial protection."And Senator Tunney had asked you how you relate that to
                    howyou feel about recent Supreme Court articles, and you said, "Thearticle you have there is
                    explicitly a tentative and rather theoreticalattempt to deal with the problem. At the end of the
                    article, Ipoint out that I think these are the conclusions that are requiredby the idea of neutral
                    principles, but that I am not sure about thewhole subject."Was that a retraction of the Indiana

                <p class="short_transcript">About to where the Supreme Court currently is. Letme say this: The Indiana
                    article was not my starting point on freespeech. I started off on free speech in a very liberal way,
                    protectingalmost everything. This was an attempt to ask in what sense isspeech different from other
                    human activities which can be regulated.I took Justice Brandeis' opinion from Whitney v. California,
                    Ibelieve, in which he said, in effect, there are four functions ofspeech: the development of the
                    faculties of the individual, the happinessto be derived from engaging in the activity, and the
                    provisionof a safety valve for society.And I suggested that those functions—the development of
                    thefaculties and the happiness—were not different from other humanactivities that develop your
                    faculties and make you happy. And theprovision of a safety valve was really a legislative matter,
                    and Isaid the discovery and spread of political truth is the only uniquefunction of speech that it
                    does not share with other human activities.So I tried to find a bright line.The bright line, I have
                    become convinced, particularly since sittingon first amendment free speech cases on the court, the
                    brightline is impossible. To say that somebody has to speak explicitly politically,you know, it is
                    like saying somebody who wants to discussa major issue in moral terms is protected only if he says,
                    "And,therefore, let us pass a law." Now, that is just silly, and the more Ithought about it, the
                    sillier it became.I do not think a bright line test is available in this area. It is aspectrum.
                    Furthermore, as another professor pointed out to me, therealm of politics extends much more through
                    life than it used to,particularly in part because of the spread of government throughoutlife. So
                    that the area of what is political or what affects politicshas expanded enormously, and fiction
                    affects it and so forth and soon.Now, I have expanded to where I am about where the currentSupreme
                    Court is, but let me say this: In this same article, I committedwhat I think is a logical fallacy. I
                    said that political speechwould have to be protected even if there were no first amendment,because
                    the framers constructed a republican form of government,great care about elections, terms of office
                    and so forth and so on.To have a government like that, without free political speech,would be an
                    anomaly. It would be nonsense.But I did not draw the correct conclusion from that. If
                    politicalspeech would have to be protected anyway, then why did they putthe first amendment in? And
                    why did they speak of freedom of thepress which is not restricted to political speech? I am afraid I
                    haveto conclude that the category has to be much broader than I madeit then. And my decision shows
                    it.</p>

                    as I understand it, was usually advocatingcivil disobedience in order to test a law, like the
                    segregationlaw, and he did it under a claim of constitutional right.Now, in our system it is often
                    true that the only way one can geta constitutional ruling on a law is to violate the law, and I
                    thinkthat was a lot of what Martin Luther King was doing. And if youdo, obviously, test the law and
                    the law is held unconstitutional, Ido not see how the person who advocated breaking it could be
                    heldliable.</p>

                    seem insome sense similar to the judge must be treated similarly. I do notthink that is true. I
                    think, in fact, legislatures and judges havemuch narrower principles that they deal with, and they
                    can still beneutral. What I was dealing with here was rather cosmic, I think.In any event, Senator,

                    rampant and we had three episodes of arsonin the law school, one in which they burned books in the
                    library. Isuppose that experience made me perhaps a little less happy than Iwould have been

                    take. Now, if you have speech advocatingviolence or forcible overthrow of the Government, it is
                    possible tosay we will take a chance and, unless the imminent danger of violenceor something of that
                    sort is here, we will protect the speechthat is also possible to say, and at the time I was thinking
                    aboutand had discussed with Bickel, the fact—relied upon by Holmes inhis Gitlow opinion—the fact
                    that we tend to think that some ofthese folks are insignificant and I suppose in America they
                    are.But I was thinking about the fact that I knew of another nationwhere funny little men in
                    raincoats, wearing mustaches, werestanding on the corner advocating forcible overthrow and
                    nobodytook them seriously and we got a Nazi regime. I do not think thatis a real problem in America,
                    so I think we can afford to have awide first amendment protection of the sort that Brandenburg
                    supplies.</p>

                    an article which you are obviously wellfamiliarwith, criticizing your free speech views from 1971,
                    12 yearsbefore. There has been a lot of discussion about it in the Nationmagazine. After a summary
                    of the article appeared in the ABAJournal, you wrote a letter to the editor in which you stated—I
                    willsummarize, but I think it's an accurate summary—"Jamie Kalven'ssummary of my views is both out
                    of date and seriously mistaken.I do not think, for example, that first amendment protectionsshould
                    apply only to speech that is explicitly political. As aresult of the responses of scholars to my
                    article, I have long sinceconcluded that many other forms of discourse, such as moral andscientific
                    debate, are central to a democratic government and deserveprotection. I have repeatedly stated this
                    position in my classes."Is that a pretty accurate summary of the way you reacted tothe Jamie Kalven

                    Benjamin Franklin saidwhen he voted in the convention for the Constitution, 200 yearsago tomorrow.He
                    said,Mr. President, I confess there are several parts of this Constitution which I donot, at
                    present, approve, but I am not sure that I shall never approve them forhaving lived long, I have
                    experienced many instances of being obliged by better informationor fuller consideration to change
                    opinions, even on important subjectswhich I once thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is
                    therefore that the older Igrow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect
                    to thejudgment of others.I have been trying to say that for 2 days now, Senator, but thisgentleman
                    from Chicago called me and gave me that quotation. Ithink that says it.</p>

                    said the political core will, in somesense, confine the first amendment's protections, but it will
                    not beconfined to politics. That is right. I think that is the way AlexanderMeiklejohn looked at it.
                    I think it is the way that HarryKalven looked at it. I think it is the way that Alexander
                    Bickellooked at it. Political speech is the paradigm case. Other kinds ofspeech inform our society
                    and make it freer and make it betterable to be efficient and govern itself, and they are all
                    protected.But, when you get to something, for example, to take the outercase, when you get to
                    pornography, it is a little hard to see whatthat has to do with any connection with the way this

                    issue of liberties and freedoms, dueprocess and equal protection, but I am a little surprised by
                    some ofyour responses to Senator Leahy so I will pick up there. When heasked you about the 1971
                    Indiana Law Review article, which hasbeen a pillar of the law attributable to you, you said, as I
                    wrote itdown that you have moved to where the Supreme Court currentlyis. If that is so, I think
                    these confirmation hearings may be verybrief indeed. Is it really so that you have moved to "where
                    the SupremeCourt currently is"?</p>

                    view, is the first half, which arguesthat judges must stick to intention, what the framers intended.
                    Thesecond half is an attempt to apply the idea of neutral principles ina rather cosmic and
                    artificial fashion to some first amendmentproblems. On the first amendment, I am now—you may give me
                    acase, Senator, that I do not agree with. I have not been following itthat closely.But as I
                    understand the Supreme Court's current position onthings like advocacy of civil disobedience and so
                    forth and so on,yes. Now, on the question of things like obscenity, the SupremeCourt seems to have
                    two positions. One is the one expressed inCohen v. California in which an obscenity was on the back
                    of ajacket a young man wore into the courthouse and the other one isin the—and the Supreme Court
                    said that that was protected by thefirst amendment.The other was in the Pacifica case, where a
                    comedian was sayingthe ten forbidden words, as he called them, over the air, on a radiostation and
                    the Supreme Court allowed the Federal CommunicationsCommission to take away the license or somehow
                    punish thestation. So, in the obscenity area, they seem to have two positions.I am not sure which is
                    the one. But on the subject of speaking, advocatingpolitical disobedience or civil disobedience or
                    advocatingoverthrow, I am about where the Supreme Court is.</p>

                    there is about it a terrifying frivolity, apoint that I must say that Alex Bickel made as well about
                    thisthing. Holmes said, about a case where a man was advocating theviolent overthrow of the
                    Government, he gave as a reason for protectingthat advocacy—now I have just said that
                    Brandenburgwould protect it and I do not mind that rationale, but what Holmessaid was that if in the
                    long run, the beliefs expressed in proletariandictatorship are destined to be accepted by the
                    dominant forces ofthe community, the only meaning of free speech is that they shouldbe given their
                    chance and have their way.In the first place, Senator, one wonders. One reason I think itdefies
                    explanation is that the dominant forces of the communityhave just passed the law he would hold
                    unconstitutional. How canhe say that we must allow a proletarian dictatorship to have itsway but a
                    law passed by a democratic majority cannot have itsway. It seems to me to defy explanation.</p>

                    writings, on a number of occasions, havetaken fundamental issue with that. So I will want to
                    retracethrough the philosophy, to see how you can come to that conclusion,because I think it is an
                    important issue.Before moving on to equal protection and the liberties argument,I just want to
                    understand what your position is at the present time.In this 1984 ABA Journal article, you say that
                    you continue tothink that obscenity and pornography do not fit the rationale forprotection,
                    referring to the first amendment rationale. Have youchanged your view on that?</p>

                    theSupreme Court, or by the lower federal courts.Otherwise, if you let a State's definition of what
                    is pornographicgovern, things that are not pornographic, in a constitutional sense,might be banned.
                    So it is that the Supreme Court, when it looks at"Carnal Knowledge," must be saying that this thing
                    is not pornographic;it does not have those characteristics that would entitle aState to ban it.I
                    have not read the case. I am almost certain that must be whatthey must be doing.</p>

                    is entirely what is takingplace there.For example, if a State passed a statute saying that there

                    central freedom in the Constitution.That means that the Supreme Court, ultimately the SupremeCourt,
                    the Federal Judiciary, when it says pornography isnot protected, it must make sure that what the
                    State calls pornographyis pornography, and that is why they are entitled to examinea State

                    goingback to the Indiana Law Review article, "There is no basis for judicialintervention to protect
                    that variety of expression we call obsceneor pornographic."Now you cannot have a determination as to
                    whether it is obscenityor pornographic until the Court takes it up, but you say, flatlyhere, that
                    there is no basis for judicial intervention.Judge Bork, I think this is important because you have
                    thisstrain running through the equal protection clause, the due processclause, through all of your
                    writings.What you are essentially challenging is any basis for judicialintervention, and of course
                    the Court has to make a determinationas to what the facts are, if they are to reach a conclusion.
                    But theissue which you have framed is whether the Court reaches thatquestion.</p>

                    classroom,but people are hurt in a courtroom, and that is the point of departure.I would raise a
                    question about the power of ideas, and the workof a thinker, and point to your own comments in the
                    antitrust fieldwhere, as you point out, there was a new idea at the University ofChicago in the
                    antitrust field. It was an idea of your mentor, heirand director, whom you have written about so
                    extensively, and itbecame the law, as you have articulated it.And I think that the ideas are very,
                    very important. When youtalk about equal protection—and your writings have focused onequal
                    protection applicable only in a racial situation, and you haveexpanded that to ethnic groups—and you
                    have expanded that evenfurther in some of your testimony today—at least as I interpretit—to a
                    reasonable standard test, and these are subjects which Iwant to explore with you at some length, and
                    I only have a fewminutes left, about 5 or 6 minutes left here today.It seems to me, in reading the
                    history of Plessy and Ferguson,and the adoption of the equal protection clause of the 14th
                    amendment,and reading Raoul Berger, that there was no question thatat the time the equal protection
                    clause of the 14th amendment wasadopted, that the framers, or ratifiers, did not intend, in the
                    remotestway, to cover desegregation. That they expected to have segregatedschools.There were many
                    States which had segregation. Five borderStates, eight Northern States. The District of Columbia
                    schoolswere segregated. The Senate gallery was segregated.So that the interpretation which you have
                    advanced, that "separatebut equal," in the absence of equality through separation mustlead to
                    integration, seems to me to be at very sharp variance withwhat the framers had intended.So that if
                    you take a consistent interpretation, you cannot cometo the result that the Supreme Court did in
                    Brown v. Board ofEducation.But even on more fundamental grounds, you could not come tothe conclusion
                    that the schools had to be integrated on due processgrounds, and you have been very critical of the
                    due process clause,saying that if there is not a specifically articulated right in theConstitution,
                    you cannot derive it from due process.But yet, the D.C. schools were desegregated. Where can you
                    findin the Constitution, in the due process clause, authority for desegregation?</p>

                    Education, and the Supreme Court therefaced a problem because the equal protection clause through
                    whichBrown moved to accomplish desegregation applies only to Statesand not to the federal
                    government.And you had, then, the problem of the District of Columbia, andthe only available
                    constitutional clause, they thought, was the dueprocess clause, which does apply to the federal
                    government.I am told that was the first time, I think, in Boiling v. Sharpe,that anybody said that
                    the due process clause contains an equalprotection component like the equal protection clause.</p>

                    then, they are not mutually exclusive,and the equal-protection concept got into the due
                    processclause. And since then it is commonplace for the courts, or for advocates,to refer to the
                    equal-protection component of the due processclause, which is what this is taken to have

                    why does the Court come to that position? Itseems to me that it goes back to a statement you made
                    yesterdayin response, I believe, to a question from Senator Thurmond, whereyou said, referring to
                    the commerce clause, that the appointmentpower meant that sooner or later, the commerce clause would
                    beinterpreted in accordance with the needs of the nation, which is avery broad articulation of what
                    the Supreme Court does, meetingthe needs of the nation.That certainly is not concrete and that

                    have recently been told—I have neverread the briefs in the Supreme Court but I know some folks
                    whohave in Brown—and it begins to look as if there is historical argumentthat the framers of the
                    14th amendment did not like segregationand may have intended to do away with it, but that—and
                    theblack codes and the segregation did not begin to come into theSouth until the troops left the
                    South, the Northern troops left theSouth. And later the Supreme Court changed. Plessy v.
                    Ferguson,after all, is a 1896 case, which is fairly long after the 14th amend286ment, Plessy v.
                    Ferguson being the case that said separate butequal is all right.But passing that, passing that
                    historical evidence, which I thinkcasts some doubt on the flat assumption that the 14th
                    amendmentreally meant separate but equal, let me say this. They wrote aclause that does not say
                    anything about separation. They wrote aclause that says "equal protection of the laws".I think it
                    may well be true, as you suggest, Senator, that theyhad an assumption which they did not enact, but
                    they had an assumptionthat equality could be achieved with separation. Over theyears it became clear
                    that that assumption would not be borne outin reality ever. Separation would never produce
                    equality.I think when the background assumption proved false, it was entirelyproper for the court to
                    say "we will carry out the rule theywrote" and if they would have been a little surprised that
                    itworked out this way, that is too bad. That is the rule they wroteand they assumed something that
                    is not true.And in that way I do not think any damage is done—you caneven look at it more severely.
                    You could say suppose they had writtena clause that said "we want equality and that can be
                    achievedby separation and we want that too."By 1954 it was perfectly apparent that you could not
                    have bothequality and separation. Now the court has to violate one aspect orthe other of that
                    clause, as I have framed it hypothetically. Itseems to me that the way the actual amendment was
                    written, itwas natural to choose the equality segment, and the court did so. Ithink it was proper
                    constitutional law, and I think we are allbetter off for it.</p>

                    that if the Supreme Court had struckdown segregation in all of the States under the equal
                    protectionclause, Congress most certainly would have stopped segregation inthe District of Columbia.
                    And it would have been a national scandalif they had not.Boiling v. Sharpe seems to have been
                    propelled by a feeling thatif we are going to do this to all of the States, we cannot let thefederal
                    government do it. I understand that feeling.</p>

                    furor. I suppose that probably thisis—your confirmation is one of the hottest issues that has
                    beenaround in a long time. I suppose like a gas burner, there are a lotof flames, but the most
                    intense flame, it seems to me, is Roe v.Wade.Now you have been asked some questions about it. I do
                    not thinkthere is any question that the pro-life people who fervently and vehementlysupport you
                    think that you will reverse it or at leastsome part of the court will reverse it.The pro-choice
                    people just as vehemently and fervently believethat you will also. There are those that probably
                    would say if thePresident did not think that you would reverse that case or jointhe majority to
                    reverse that case, that he would not have appointedyou. You can go on down with various
                    speculations. I do not thinkthere is much question that this is a major issue.There are those that
                    contend that the pro-choice people have basicallygenerated a heat among the civil rights coalition
                    and thatthe civil rights coalition are mistakenly equating abortion rightswith civil rights. Whether
                    that would be true, I do not know. I donot know but it remains to be seen.There is no question that
                    the spotlight is on this issue and it isan issue that I think deserves clarification and directness
                    on yourpart.You answered the question about Roe v. Wade and what youwould do. I believe that Senator
                    Hatch, and maybe someone else,asked you questions about it. But, as I recall and looking at
                    therecord, you had basically three questions that you said you wouldask a lawyer. I do not know
                    whether you said asking a lawyer is aninvasion on your part or not. If not, then we can clarify
                    that.Basically, you had indicated that you would ask the lawyer firstto see if he could find a right
                    of privacy ought to be found in anyone of the specific amendments, but in some principal fashion
                    fromthe Constitution.So I want to know not only where you got it but what it covers.So I suppose
                    that that question would be: Where do you find in theConstitution a general right of privacy?And
                    second, you said that if you would tell that lawyer that ifyou cannot find a general right of
                    privacy, can you derive a rightto an abortion or at least to a limitation upon anti-abortion fromthe
                    Constitution.You said that you would—if after listening to the arguments andto those two questions
                    that you would raise, then if did not soundlike it was going to be a viable theory, which would be
                    directed tothose two, then you would say you would like for him to arguewhether it is a kind of case
                    which should not be overruled, which isbasically stare decisis.Now on the general right of
                    privacy—well, first, let me quotewhat you have been quoted and this comes from magazines andsome of
                    your writings—if it is incorrect, then correct me—Roe v.Wade is in itself an unconstitutional
                    decision, a serious and whollyunjustifiableusurpation of eight legislative authorities. Is that
                    acorrect recital of a statement you have made?</p>

                    Roev. Wade is based coming out of Griswold, and you had two, one JusticeGoldberg out of the ninth

                <p class="short_transcript">All right. I think it has to be, in the first place,clear that the prior
                    decision was erroneous. I mean, not just shakybut really wrong in terms of constitutional theory,
                    constitutionalprinciple. But that is not sufficient to overrule. I have discussedthese factors
                    before, but I will mention them again, and a numberof factors counsel against overruling. For
                    example, the developmentof private expectations on the part of the citizenry. Is this aninternalized
                    belief and a right? The growth of institutions, governmentalinstitutions, private institutions
                    around a ruling.Now, I have given two examples of that. One was the commerceclause and one was the
                    free press clause, in both of which casesmany institutions have grown up in dependence upon that
                    andthey have become part of the fabric of our national life. The needfor continuity and stability in
                    the law, which is certainly always afactor to be weighed. The need for predictability in legal
                    doctrine. Ithink the preservation of confidence in the Court by not sayingthat this crowd just does
                    whatever they feel like as the personnelchanges. And the respect due to the judgment of predecessors
                    on alegal issue, if they have explained their judgment.Now, of course, against that is—if it is
                    wrong, and secondly,whether it is a dynamic force so that it continues to produce wrongand
                    unfortunate decisions. I think that was one of the reasons thecourt in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins
                    overruled Swift v. Tyson—a degenerativeforce, I think what Brandeis or somebody maybe calleddynamic
                    potential. That is the kind of thing you would have toweigh and that is a very fact-based
                    consideration, a very particularisticconsideration about whether this is the kind of case that
                    goesone way or the other. I think the Court has got to work out abetter theory of stare decisis than
                    it has now articulated.</p>

                    some of which you have recanted,others which you have not, that if—when I look at those, I cancome
                    to conclusions depending on the result that I or somebodyelse may want to reach on this matter. So,
                    in trying to be fair toyou, we ought to basically look at the overall total man.On one hand, we have
                    those that, in effect, contend that you area right-wing extremist, who has, in the back lobes of his
                    mind, aradical right-wing agenda that if you get on the Court, you want toput that agenda into
                    place. On the other hand, there are those thatsay you are a highly intellectual individual and that
                    you have beenan evolving individual who has great intellectual curiosity whowishes to explore
                    different, unconventional concepts and theoriesand experience the unusual.From reading your history
                    and background as reported in newspapers,publications and all sorts of things, I think that we
                    couldsay that there have been unusual things. One interpretation is thatyou have great intellectual
                    curiosity. I have gone back and lookedat some of the things from your youth and have seen how you
                    haveeither involved or, on the other hand, that you have displayed abackground of being a zealot at
                    times.For example, in your early youth, they list you as being a socialist,that you stated that
                    socialism sounded like a swell idea and rebellionalso sounded like a swell idea, at one time. Then,
                    there arewritings in some of the papers to the effect that you succeeded ingetting a young friend of
                    yours to attend a Communist party meeting.That you were a champion boxer. You were also the
                    presidentof your class and editor of the school paper. And yet you went intothe Marine Corps and I
                    assume—did you volunteer going into theMarine Corps?</p>

                    nothingwild about it. As Solicitor General, I carried out my duties innot a speculative or extreme
                    fashion at all. And as a judge on theCourt of Appeals, I think I have not been extreme in any
                    way.And I don't think I have said much extreme in my life. Youknow, Mr. Cutler had an article in
                    this morning's paper, which Ithink was put in the record, showing that my positions on thesevarious
                    cases are shared by a lot of what nobody can doubt aremainstream Justices and professors.Now I did
                    make the remark about explicitly political speech. Itwas not a good idea. I have abandoned it. I
                    prefer "abandoned" or"evolved out of to the word "recanted," which sounds a little likesomething
                    else. And a few other things I have grown out of, but alot of the stuff I still believe.</p>

                    series of my positions, political positions,ranging from my socialism in my youth to my liberal
                    positionsto my more conservative positions. None of those changestook place in connection with any

                    just point to a change in my legal philosophy whichis the most dramatic change in my writing, and
                    that is, from December1968 when I wrote the Fortune article called "The SupremeCourt Needs A New
                    Philosophy," accepting the idea of Griswold v.Connecticut as a reasonable—not the penumbras and
                    emanations,but the idea of reasoning from different provisions to a more generalright, to 1971 when
                    I took it all back, I was offered nothing inthere. Nothing was in prospect. There was no reason for
                    me tochange my mind except that I changed my mind.</p>

                    am, and my colleague, SenatorSimon, you think your turn will never come. It is like the 15-year-old
                    boy who can't wait to turn 16 so he can get his driver'slicense. That last year seems
                    interminable.Judge Bork, my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Simpson, wascertainly on target when he
                    said he thought Senators would beunable, and others would be unable to resist the temptation to
                    pickat the old scab of Watergate. And, indeed, that scab has beenpicked at in this room again, that
                    very old scab, and I only want tocome to it for just a moment. Since it has already been picked at,
                    Ihope to shed a little more light on that. So let me ask you a couplequestions about the role you
                    played in the firing of Archibald Cox.You said earlier that at the time you discharged Cox you had
                    theunderstanding from Eliot Richardson, the Attorney General, whohad been to the White House with
                    President Nixon, that the Presidentwas determined at all costs to fire Archibald Cox. Am I rightin
                    that?</p>

                    the Department of Justice, the successionregulation, I was the third and last person on that
                    regulation.So there was nobody behind me, by regulation, to step into myshoes. That means the
                    President would have had a free hand in appointingan acting Attorney General.I suppose he would have
                    learned, if I had resigned—he wouldhave known and he quickly would have learned, since I was
                    thefirst person without a promise to the Senate or other commitment,the others would not have done
                    it either, if I had resigned. I don'tthink he would have even bothered to ask them.The simple
                    solution for him would have been to appoint one ofthe White House counsel, probably, as acting
                    Attorney General,who would have fired Cox. And at that point, I don't think anybodywould have stayed
                    with that acting Attorney General.You must remember that there was great resentment in the
                    Departmentof Justice about Mr. Nixon already because he had demandedresignation letters when his
                    new—when his second termstarted down as far as I think GS-16's or 15's. He made the
                    reallyunprecedented demand that all the top echelon sign resignationletters, and they were not very
                    happy with him. And if he had sentin an outsider whom they did not know to discharge Mr. Cox, Ithink
                    there would have been massive departures. And Mr. Richardsonthought so, too.</p>

                    grosslyunfair that he should be excluded from the firm on the groundsthat he was Jewish.So I—and I
                    went and talked to a classmate of his who was alsothen at the firm. A man named Alan Oaks. And Oaks
                    confirmedme in my view of this fellow, and so I went to the senior partner,two senior partners, and
                    said you can't do this. You can't—we can'toperate a law firm that way. And one or two of them
                    weren't toohappy, but they finally agreed. They said, we will give him a trial.He was a great
                    success.</p>

                    amount to bring the country together andbring blacks into the mainstream, and I think that is the
                    way Ishould have judged the statute in the first place, instead of onthese abstract libertarian
                    principles.I think the Voting Rights Act has been enormously successful inimproving the quality of
                    black life, particularly in the South, becausethey became a voting group that politicians had to
                    listen toonce they got access to the polls.I think the Fair Housing Act was an extremely good

                    Notonly did you rule in favor of the plaintiff who was a woman, butthis is a case where you ruled in
                    favor of an individual against theinstitution of the Government. And there is hardly a worse

                    is filing an amicus brief, I think he has more latitude, becausehe is speaking to the Court not for

                <p class="short_transcript">One area that is of concern to me is an areawhere you on the Court would
                    have a great deal to say, where Congresshas to a great extent stayed out, and that is the whole
                    questionof where we draw the line between church and state.What we have evolved is a system that is
                    basically very healthy,both for religion and for government. I am concerned that we don'tmake major
                    modifications of it.In 1984, in a speech at the University of Chicago, you talkedabout the three
                    tests that are used. Let me quote Justice Powell onwhat is called the Lemon test. Justice Powell, in
                    Wallace v. Jaffree,wrote "I write separately to express additional views and to respondto criticism
                    of the three-pronged Lemon test. Lemon v. Kurtzmanidentified standards that have proven useful in
                    analyzing caseafter case, both in our decisions and those of other courts. It is theonly coherent
                    test the majority of the Court has ever adopted."In your speech at the University of Chicago, you
                    talk about thattest rather critically. You say, if this text is accurate, "The thirdtest, no
                    excessive entanglement between government and religion,is impossible to satisfy. Government is
                    inevitably entangled withreligion." You then talk about entanglement, though the third partof the
                    test is not simply entanglement but excessive entanglement.Then in a speech at Brookings, in 1985,
                    if this is correct, you say,"Many observers expected a major recasting of doctrine. But theSupreme
                    Court this past term surprised them by adhering to theold test. Eventually, however, we may see such
                    a reformulation,not because I think the attitude of the Court will change—although,of course, it
                    may—and not because of political pressures,but because, as observers of this area commonly remark,
                    presentdoctrine is so unsatisfactory."Then let me skip a few sentences. You say, "Constitutional
                    doctrinecannot separate either religion in law or religion in politics."Then I will skip several
                    sentences, but I don't think I'm takingthings out of context. "A relaxation of current,
                    rigidly-secularistdoctrine would in the first place permit some sensible things to bedone." And then
                    I'll skip a sentence. You say, "I suspect that thegreatest perceived change would be in the
                    reintroduction of somereligion into public schools."Now, do these texts that I have quote you
                    accurately, as far asyou know?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">There are only two cases I have ever criticized inthis area, and they're
                    both very marginal cases. In this case, Ithought the Supreme Court had gone fairly far when it
                    said—notunanimously, as I recall—that a school could not put up the TenCommandments in the school on
                    the wall, even though it put underneaththe Ten Commandments the statement that "this is notan
                    endorsement of a religion; it's part of our cultural heritage", as,indeed, it is fundamental to both
                    the Jewish and Christian traditions.That's all I meant by that. It seemed to me it was getting
                    alittle excessive, I thought.The other thing I said, "some sensible things to be done"—I wastalking
                    about Aguilar v. Felton, in which, under a federal program,the city of New York had public school
                    teachers go into privateschools, including religious schools, to teach educationally
                    deprivedchildren who were far behind in their subjects, remedial readingand remedial arithmetic and
                    so forth.The program was conducted in rooms bare of religious symbolism;the materials used had no
                    religious content; there was nointeraction between the public school teacher and the
                    religiouspeople—they often weren't even of the same faith.That passed the first two tests of the
                    Lemon test, secular in purposeand did not advance religion, but it failed because they saidthere was
                    excessive entanglement since the city had to make surethat religion didn't creep into the program.
                    That struck me as kindof an odd thing to strike down a program.The lower court judge, who
                    agreed—Henry Friendly, a famousjudge—who agreed that the program failed the third aspect of theLemon
                    test on excessive entanglement, because the city had topolice to make sure that religion didn't get
                    into it, said that it wasa program that had done much good and little, if any, discernibleharm. So
                    it seemed to me to be kind of too bad.Now, there was some suggestion, I guess, that if they had
                    takenthe children out of the school and walked them down the block andinto a trailer, they could
                    have had the program. That seemed to mea little odd.But this area is full of line drawing and
                    sometimes you thinkthey draw the line too far on one side or the other. I have not inany way
                    questioned, and would not in any way question, the basicimportance of the establishment clause in
                    preventing the establishmentof religion, or the basic importance of the free exerciseclause. But
                    sometimes, and it's often 5 to 4, a case like Aguilar or acase like the Ten Commandment case doesn't
                    seem to me as essentialto prevent the establishment of religion. But, you know, that'son the margin.
                    I'm not talking about anything more than that.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Let me ask another question on line drawing,without projecting how you might
                    rule in the future. Let me giveyou a very practical example.When I served in the House, my
                    colleague, Congressman DanGlickman, told me about when he was in the fourth grade. He happensto be
                    Jewish, growing up in a community that was largely notJewish. Every day he was excused from the
                    classroom while theyhad a prayer, and then he was brought back in. Every day, all theother fourth
                    graders were being told that Danny Glickman is different,and yes, every day he was being told that
                    he was different.We have the Engel decision in 1962, of a prescribed prayer thatwas to be required
                    daily. The courts ruled that was unconstitutional.As you reflect on that, was that a sound decision?

                <p class="short_transcript">The first is from Mr. Warren I. Cikins, who is asenior staff member at
                    Brookings and ran this seminar program atwhich I spoke—and he was there. Mr. Cikins doesn't say in
                    theletter, but he tells me—and I'm sure he wouldn't mind my sayingit—that he's devout Jew. He kept
                    notes. It's his program and hekept notes of the evening.He starts off by saying that he's quite
                    concerned about the factthat people—it was off the record, meaning a give and take—thatpeople said
                    what happened. He says:Whatever one's views are about Judge Bork's qualifications to serve on the
                    SupremeCourt, he certainly is entitled to a thorough and accurate review of his opinions.In
                    examining my notes of that meeting, I find no reference to any specific SupremeCourt decision but
                    only the expression of broad concepts and principles. Ifind no opinion expressed by the Judge on the
                    issue of school prayer but only thecomment that the current turmoil in constitutional law may force
                    some revisions.One must remember that the context of this session at Brookings was the airingof a
                    wide range of views on matters of church and state, in an aura of reconciliation,not confrontation.
                    While Judge Bork was challenged frequently by members ofthe seminar, he responded with grace and an
                    inquiring mind and willingly extendedthe discussion period well beyond its adjournment time.Since
                    this is a serious matter, Senator, I do not come at this witheither a religious or an anti-religious
                    bias. I come at this—But thisletter, which was printed in the Post, is from Rabbi Joshua O.
                    Haberman.He said:It is a good thing that I was there when Judge Bork met with a group of clergy ata
                    Brookings Institution dinner for religious leaders in September, 1985, because if Ihad nothing but
                    your account from the paper of that evening's discussion, I woulddraw entirely wrong conclusions
                    about Judge Bork's view on church and stateissues. Your reporter was not present at the meeting. I
                    was. As a rabbi, with astrong commitment to the separation of church and state, I would have been
                    greatlyalarmed if Judge Bork had expressed any tendency to move away from our
                    constitutionalguarantee of religious freedom inequality. I heard nothing of the sort.As a matter of
                    fact, the rest of the letter is so laudatory that Ithink it would be improper for me to read it, but
                    I would like youto read it, Senator. [Laughter.]</p>

                    be for you or not—that youhave gone into much greater detail on cases than any recent witnessthat we
                    have had before this committee.Let me get into an area where I have some concerns with youranswers,
                    both yesterday and today, and that is that I think I sensea tendency to view the Constitution as
                    fairly rigid, in terms of theexpansion of liberty. The Supreme Court is the basic guarantor
                    ofliberty.As we look at the application of it, wherever possible, that libertyshould be expanded.
                    You mentioned Justice Harlan in the Griswoldcase that Senator Biden mentioned. Justice Harlan in
                    hisopinion referred to his earlier opinion in Poe v. Ullman.Justice Harlan says, in a couple of
                    sentences that I had neverseen before, that I think really are significant, and I'm going to usethem
                    on other occasions in the future. In that opinion he says,"Liberty is not a series of isolated
                    points pricked out in terms ofthe taking of property, the freedom of speech, press and religion,the
                    right to keep and bear arms, the freedom from unreasonablesearches and seizures and so on. It is a
                    rational continuum which,broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial,
                    arbitraryimpositions and purposeless restraints." That's pretty powerful,pretty eloquent.</p>

                    redistribution of liberty.Now, that seems to me to be arithmetically solid. I don't thinkthere is
                    any way you can get around it. But if the Constitution saysthe majority doesn't have that liberty,
                    they shouldn't; where it saysthey do have that liberty, it should.</p>

                    Robert Bork. It happens to be that the DredScott decision, I think, is the first time the doctrine
                    of substantivedue process was raised by the Supreme Court—substantive dueprocess being the doctrine
                    that the due process clause imposeslimits on government, and the Court makes it up. It is one of
                    thesefree-floating things again which the Court used in the past tostrike down economic
                    regulation.Chief Justice Taney in Dred Scott said that it would be a violationof the due process
                    clause to take away a black slave from awhite owner.So you see, these doctrines which give judges
                    power to make uptheir own constitutional law, which was what Taney did in thatcase, do not always
                    produce results that today we think are fine;sometimes, they produce disastrous results. And Dred
                    Scott produceda disastrous result not only for Dred Scott, but for theNation and helped to lead up
                    to the Civil War.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Let me put it this way, Senator, and this is the bestI can do. If you will
                    read those cases—I have got a good votingrecord on civil rights and constitutional rights and so
                    forth, but ifyou will read the one essay—I wrote an extended essay on this,largely because my good
                    friend, now Justice Scalia, was going theother way on the case, and we got into a wrangle about
                    it—andthat is Oilman v. Evans, in which I apply and expand a firstamendment freedom for the press. I
                    do not believe that constitutionalfreedom should be given a narrow or a crabbed construction,and I
                    have never given such a narrow or a crabbed construction tothem. In fact, just the other day, I
                    think a case came down on thedouble jeopardy clause in which I reversed a new sentence ondouble
                    jeopardy grounds. That, I should say, before somebodymakes the accusation that has been made, that
                    was a case that wasvoted on and assigned to me long before this nomination came up,assigned to me by
                    Judge Mikva, who was the senior member of thepanel.You look at my opinions, and you will see no
                    reason to expectany crabbed or narrow interpretation of any clause. And thoseclauses have to evolve
                    as circumstances and technologies and otherthings change, so that they are continued to be given
                    their full andfair value.But, Senator, I must confess, if you say to me here is an
                    outrageousstatute, and that is all the lawyer can say to me, that is notenough for me to strike it
                    down. It may be one of the worst statutesthe world has ever seen. Well, why should I engage in
                    hyperbolemyself? It may be just a terrible statute, and you and I wouldagree that no civilized
                    community could really live with a statutelike that. But unless I as a judge, unelected,
                    unrepresentative, havea warrant in the Constitution, fairly applied, fairly interpreted, Iwill not
                    strike it down because I regard it as outrageous.</p>

                    property," talking about the use of the word"liberty" in the 14th amendment, "the freedom of speech,

                    seizures, and so on. It is a rational continuumwhich, broadly speaking, includes the freedom from

                    to bring this up again—by a reasonablebasis test under the equal protection clause, because if you
                    get anunreasonable restraint or a purposeless distinction, it is not goingto meet a reasonable basis
                    test. And I suppose I should fill that outby saying that I think the Court, using the reasonable
                    basis test—which Justice Stevens does, and maybe some others do—I think Iwould come out just in
                    about the same position that the Court is inon such matters as racial discrimination, gender
                    discrimination,and so forth. I just regard it as a much more satisfactory methodologythan this each
                    group has its own tier of analysis kind of constitutionaltheory that we have now.But I do not think
                    the results would differ substantially. I cannotthink of a Supreme Court gender discrimination case
                    that wouldcome out differently in my mind under a reasonable basis test. AndI think that is a better
                    constitutional methodology to accomplishwhat Justice Harlan was saying there than is a substantive
                    dueprocess methodology.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Okay. Then that is the way we will go if we can.Judge, I would like to go
                    back to questions that I started withyou on Tuesday, and I suspect you are going to find that
                    happeningwith all of us going back to where some of us left off. It is kind ofhard to go bouncing
                    back and forth like this, I realize so if there isanything you do not understand about my asking and
                    you want toslow it down, just holler.I asked you about the, quote, "dozens of cases" that were
                    wrong,that the Supreme Court decisions were wrong, and you said in responseto me that you would have
                    to go back and start through thecase books again to pick out what they were so we did not get
                    todiscuss really the dozens of cases that were wrong, and it is an areathat is important because I
                    think it ties into what I think you havesensed on both sides of the aisle here into this question
                    aboutprecedent and how binding precedent is, how important it is.Many of my colleagues have
                    expressed concern that decisionsthat we have come to accept may be upset. So I would like to
                    beginthis morning by talking about precedent.Judge, you said when you testified before this
                    committee, and Imentioned this before, back in 1982 that "a judge ought not overturnprior decisions
                    unless he thinks it is absolutely clear that theprior decision was wrong and perhaps
                    pernicious."Now, again, I am not trying to nail you to quotes but just theideas. You said yesterday
                    in your response to questions from SenatorSpecter that the substantive due process clause which, I
                    mightadd, is the place from where the general right of privacy has been derivedthat I like and you
                    do not like too much, not that you do notlike privacy but you do not like it being found in the 14th
                    amendment;that you indicated that substantive due process was "pernicious."You used that phrase
                    again yesterday.Based on your own standard about what you do when a case ispernicious, it seems to
                    me that the entire line of privacy decisionswould be in some jeopardy. It is through the right of
                    privacy thatthe Supreme Court protected married couples in their decisionsand found a "marital right
                    to privacy."It is through the right of privacy that the Court protected theright of a grandmother to
                    live with her grandsons in spite of anordinance saying that you had to be a nuclear family. It is
                    throughthe right of privacy that the rights of a father to see his childrenhave been protected.What
                    has been protected, in other words, are, at least from myperspective, important and fundamental
                    liberties that, in my view,predate the Constitution. I have them because I exist, at least frommy
                    point of view.Now, if the decisions recognizing these rights and liberties, someof the ones I
                    mentioned, are as you put it, perniciousâ€”and you didnot say they were pernicious; you said using
                    the due process clausewas perniciousâ€”if they are pernicious, then I have a problem.It seems to me
                    that the cases, some of which I mentionedâ€”I didnot mention the case names, but the subject matter
                    in those caseâ€”then those cases are up for grabs. So what I am trying to get asense of is putting
                    your view of when a case is wrongly decided orpernicious then a Supreme Court Justice should
                    overturn it andyou are labeling the due process clause and finding the due processclause, within it
                    a right to privacy, as pernicious.Putting them together, and I am not trying to play with
                    words,putting them together, it seems to me that you areâ€”bound may bethe wrong word, but at least
                    would be inclined intellectually tooverrule these decisions or similar decisions that will come up,
                    andthere will be similar decisions off all these issues, you might rulethat the "right does not
                    exist."Could you comment on that generally?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I would be glad to, Mr. Chairman.The clause of the Constitution to which you
                    refer, and I seem tohave left my copy in the briefcase, says that no person shall be deprivedof
                    life, liberty or property without due process of law.It seems to me historically clear that that is
                    a clause that protectsprocedures. You are entitled to fair procedures before you aredeprived of
                    anything. Its only substantive content is that it is usedto incorporate most of the Bill of Rights
                    which originally appliedonly to the federal government, it is used to incorporate most ofthe Bill of
                    Rights against State governments with which I have noquarrel.But there is yet a third meaning which
                    is that judges decidewhen they do not like a law that somehow due process has a substantivecontent
                    other than incorporation by which they can makelaw.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That is right. Applying it against legislative action,and I think I
                    mentioned yesterday, and I brought it because thereis a good discussion of it in this book by
                    Professor David Currie, Ithink the first use of substantive due process came in the DredScott
                    decision, a case in which a black slave claimed that he hadbecome free because he had entered into
                    territory where the MissouriCompromise forbad slavery.Chief Justice Taney ruled against the black
                    slave, and he saidthisâ€”this is the first use that I know ofâ€”he said an act of Congresswhich
                    deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty orpropertyâ€”he is talking about the slave
                    masterâ€”an act of Congresswhich deprives a citizen of the United States of his liberty or
                    propertymerely because he came himself or brought his property into aparticular territory of the
                    United States and had committed no offenseagainst the laws, could hardly be dignified with the name
                    ofdue process of law.What Taney did was decide that an act of Congress forbiddingslavery in certain
                    territories was unconstitutional under the dueprocess clause. I just want to point that out because
                    that indicatesthat the due process clause when it is used substantively has everycapacity to be
                    pernicious.I would like to go on with the cases you mentioned, if I may, Mr.Chairman.</p>

                    face the constitutional issue because I didnot think Congress had faced the issue before us. The
                    issue beforeus was the Congress' witness protection program, and as we mentionedthe other day, in
                    that a woman who was divorced but hadchildren remarried and remarried a criminal who testified for
                    thegovernment and the government hid him from everybody, newname, new identity, et cetera, new
                    location, and she went with himwith her children, and the father of the children could not
                    findthem.Now, it was not necessary it seemed to me to go right to the constitutionalquestion because
                    under Pennsylvania law, it looked as ifthe father had a right under State law to visit his children,
                    andthere was no evidence that Congress had thought about that problemand decided to preempt or wipe
                    out State law on the subject.I wanted to remand for consideration of that question and in myopinion,
                    I was trying to call the problem to the attention of Congressso that Congress could decide initially
                    whether it wanted towipe out those rights.Then I would have faced the constitutional question if it
                    hadcome back.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NOW, having said that, let me move along thesame lines to this notion that
                    has come up in the past of core ideasthat people mention. Let me be more specific.Yesterday you
                    indicated that although you did not like the generalizedright of privacy or use of substantive due
                    process, you timeand again pointed out that certain core ideas were protected andthey were protected
                    in first amendment you pointed out, privacy.First amendment, fourth amendment, fifth amendment,
                    eighthamendment. You went down the list.Now, what I would like to ask you is this. If Justices
                    Harlan,Powell, Frankfurter, Jackson, Cardozo had found a fundamentalright of privacy or a
                    fundamental liberty to be protected under anotherspecific amendment to the Constitution, there would
                    nothave been any occasion to see that the Constitution also containsthe basic right of
                    privacy.Obviously they could not find it in any single amendment. Therefore,my question is putting
                    aside all the specific amendments youhave mentioned either now or during the past several days do
                    youbelieve that the Constitution recognizes a marital right to privacy?</p>

                    anybodyhas been able to find it, is either in the ninth and/or in the 14thamendment, and both of

                    interfere with it becauseeven the law in Connecticut was never usedâ€”nobody ever went inan arrested
                    a married couple for using contraceptives or eventhreatened it, and I do not think it could be
                    enforced given thefourth amendment and given the lack of enforcement.So I don't know offhandâ€”I
                    cannot construct just sitting here aconstitutional argument. Maybe I could if I spend a few days at
                    it,but I don't think it is a live issue because no state has ever tried toenforce such a law.</p>

                    was explicitly political speech, and youhave said at some length yesterday that you now think that
                    thatbright line was wrong.But it seems to me that as of 1979 and 1985, you had drawn anew line, not
                    as bright, but a new line. Your new line, it seems tome, by some of the testimony yesterday and what
                    I have read,seems to me would protect more speech than your old line did butnot nearly as much as
                    the currently Supreme Court does.In your 1979 speech at Michigan, you explained your view
                    thatpolitical speech is at the core of the first amendment, and youspoke to that yesterday, and you
                    went on to say, and I quote, andagain I do not want to hold you to a specific quote but it is the

                    You said, "But there is no occasion on this rationaleto throw constitutional protection around forms
                    of expression thatdo not directly feed the democratic process. It is sometimes saidthat works of art
                    or indeed any form of expression are capable ofinfluencing attitudes, but in these indirect and

                    political attitudes, butare not on that account immune from regulation."In a 1985 interview with the
                    California Lawyer, you told theinterviewer about an argument with Professor Harry Kalven. Yousaid
                    Professor Kalven argued that the first amendment should beinterpreted by, and I quote, "starting
                    with political speech andmoving all the way out to paintings, statutes, dancing and so
                    forth.Anything that is expressive is protected." That was Kalven.This was the view, you said, of
                    Professor Kalven with whom youhad said you disagreed. You went onto tell the interviewer, and
                    Iquote, "that it seems to me that to be able to level a generalitythat goes well beyond what the
                    framers intended, I doubt if theyintended to protect some forms of dancing from regulation."Now, as
                    I understand it, that meant that you believed that thefirst amendment only protected speech that
                    related to politics or tothe political process. It did not have to be speech explicitly
                    discussingpolitics. It did not have to say it was dealing with politics, butit had to be related to
                    the political process.That was not your 1971 view but it was your 1979 and 1985views. That new line,
                    it seems to me, you have drawn. Now, thatview, quite frankly, troubles me. All sorts of artistic
                    speechâ€”paintings,hanging a nude in a gallery or your home of some greatartist, dancing, the
                    Joffrey Ballet or any other ballet that some aremore expressive than others and in some
                    conservatives their attiresomehow is viewed as being provocativeâ€”have nothing to do withpolitics,
                    that is, paintings and dancing.But they are still, in my view, very important and I believe
                    protectedby the first amendment. I do not believe that State legislaturesor any government body
                    should be able to sensor or suppressexpressions just because it is unrelated to expression of a
                    politicalnotion.I am not talking about obscene expression. I am talking aboutnonpolitical expression
                    like, as I said, the American Ballet Company,Reuben's nudes, or dancing on American Bandstand.Now,
                    under your 1985 theory, Judge, the government, as I see it,a government, a county council, city
                    council, State, could sensorthis nonpolitical speech. Is that still your view and do I have
                    thatcorrect?</p>

                    they had alot of trouble with a question of whether a community could bandancing in the nude in a

                    the amendment allowing states to controlliquor to finally bar the nude dancing.</p>

                    a theoretical line. It seems tome the current body of doctrine, the current body of law which
                    iswell-settled protects that, and I certainly have no desire to go runningaround trying to upset
                    settled bodies of law which are not, tosay the least, pernicious. Those decisions are not
                    pernicious.You may argue and say that, well, a different line could havebeen drawn. I do not know if
                    it could or not, but those are caseswhich I would certainly not classify as pernicious. I would not
                    classifythem as clearly wrong, and I would accept that line of firstamendment cases gladly, not
                    grudgingly, gladly.If I were being a theoretician again and starting from scratchwith the first

                    my time is up, let me conclude by suggestingthat in 1984 your letter to the ABA that you have spoken
                    to, asI read that letter, you still focused on the relationship to the politicalprocess of speech
                    and after you started off by saying that thefirst amendment applies to more than just speech, that
                    is, quote,"explicitly political" you went on to say, and I quote, "I have longsince concluded that
                    many other forms of discourse such as moraland scientific debate are central to democratic
                    government and deserveprotection. I continue to think that obscenity and pornographydo not fit this
                    rationale."In 1984, you did not decide that moral and scientific speechshould be protected for its
                    own sake. Instead you said it should beprotected because you had decided that it fit your rationale
                    for protection.Do you understand what I am driving at here?</p>

                    something that I did not hear. Nobody, Ithink, doubts that the core of the first amendment is
                    politicalspeech. Harry Kalven did not doubt it and Alexander Meicklejohndid not doubt it.The New
                    York Times v. Sullivan case, which threw protectionsaround people from libel actions, focused upon
                    public officials,public figures and so forth because they are the subject of politicsand
                    comment.Everybody, including the Supreme Court, starts from the politicalspeech core, and that is
                    the most strongly protected. But let meread what I did say in this thing. The German professor, they
                    werein, I forget, in Hamburg or someplace, asked me something, and Isaid, "I cannot tell you much
                    more than that there is a spectrumof, I think, political speech. Speech about public affairs and
                    publicofficials is the core of the amendment. Protection is going to spreadout from there as I say
                    in the moral speech and the scientificspeech into fiction and so forth."That statement explicitly
                    contemplates protection for fiction andso forth. Whatever that is. Then I said there comes a point,
                    whichyou quoted, where it is no longer related to these.I think when you get the speech or print
                    which is purely forsexual gratification, pornography or obscenity, I fail to see its connectionto
                    anything.</p>

                    have made comments onthe equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. Some havecriticized you for
                    what they understand to be your position. Thismorning I would like to explore your understanding and
                    analysis ofthe 14th amendment.The 14th amendment reads, "Nor shall any State deprive anyperson of
                    life, liberty, or property without due process of law nordeny to any person within its jurisdiction
                    the equal protection ofthe laws."Now, let us start with the basics. The language says, "No
                    Stateshall deny equal protection to any person." Does that mean everyperson in the State must be
                    treated the same by every law?</p>

                    andhonest people the same way. We make a strong distinction betweenthose two groups, and that is a
                    valid distinction.Now, when we come down to other groups, to other people, thequestion is is the
                    distinction made between them by a law valid? Ican go on about that, Senator, but if you want to ask
                    a furtherquestion in this area, I can wait for that.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NO, I hope not, Senator. The Supreme Court is alittle bit divided on this
                    issue. There are two schools of thought upthere. One is that you identify a group and then decide
                    what levelof scrutiny you will give to any law that disadvantages that groupin some way, and I think
                    that is a little paradoxical given the languageof the amendment which you have quoted which means
                    itapplies to all persons so that I would think that no group could beexcluded from the protection of
                    the amendment as a group.What the equal protection clause requires is that people who aresimilarly
                    situated be treated equally, and in the case of race, thereis no valid basis for a distinction, and
                    so the 14th amendment requiresequality absolutely.In the case of gender, there are only a few bases
                    of distinction,and I got into this topic with Senator DeConcini yesterday. I mentionedsome of the
                    extreme cases, but I think those are almost theonly cases in which a distinction between the sexes
                    would be allowable.For example, gender is irrelevant to your ability to work as alawyer or as a
                    doctor or anything else. I agree completely with theSupreme Court case of Reed v. Reed, which said
                    that a State statutesaying that if there is a man and a woman in the family, theone who is
                    preferred, who becomes the administrator of an estate,must be the man. That is an irrational
                    distinction and it wasstruck down, and it should have been.The fact is a reasonable basis approach
                    which rejects artificialdistinctions and discriminations would arrive at all of the same results,I
                    think, or virtually all of the same results that a majority ofthe Supreme Court has arrived at using
                    a group approach and anintermediate level of scrutiny approach. There is really no differencein
                    anything except the methodology, but women are covered,every person is covered by the qual
                    protection clause.I am glad to have a chance to go into this because people seem tothink that a
                    reasonable basis test is a very weak protection. It isnot. It has become a weak protection in
                    economic areas because theCourt has found distinctions there to be allowable that we do notallow
                    elsewhere. But it is not a weak protection in areas of race,gender, and so forth.Let me point out
                    what the Supreme Court has done in the pastin this area because these are cases I disagree with. I
                    disagree withthe Supreme Court in these cases. In Kotch v. Board of River PortPilot
                    Commissionersâ€”this is my Indiana article, by the way, onpage 12. The Court decided that a State
                    could grant pilots' licenses,river boat pilots' licenses, only to persons who were related byblood
                    to existing pilots, and they could deny licenses to persons otherwiseas well or better qualified.
                    The Supreme Court upheld thatridiculous distinction back then, not too long ago. That seems to mea
                    distinction that would fail on a reasonable basis test.Then in Goesaert v. Cleary, a case from 1948,
                    the Court said thata State could refuse to license women as bartenders unless they arethe wives or
                    daughters of male owners of licensed liquor establishments.That was upheld in Goesaert v. Cleary.
                    That, too, is a ridiculousdistinction and would fail under the reasonable basis test. Andso
                    forth.The reasonable basis test would give us all of the protections,maybe more than you would get
                    by identifying particular groupsand deciding which level of scrutiny we get. I have just been
                    shownJustice Stevens' remark in City of Cleburne which was a distinctionabout retarded children. It
                    says, "In every equal protection case"â€”this is Justice Stevensâ€”"we have to ask certain basic
                    questions.What class is harmed by the legislation, and has it been subjectedto a tradition of
                    disfavor by our laws? What is the public purposethat is being served by the law? What is the
                    characteristic of thedisadvantaged class that justifies the disparate treatment? In mostcases, the
                    answers to these questions will tell us whether the statutehas a rational basis. The answers will
                    result in the virtuallyautomatic invalidation of racial classification and in the validationof most
                    economic classifications, but they will provide differing resultsin cases involving classifications
                    based on alienage, gender, orillegitimacy. But that is not because we apply an intermediatestandard
                    of review in those cases; rather, it is because the characteristicsof these groups are sometimes
                    relevant and sometimes irrelevantto a valid public purpose, or more specifically, to the purposethat
                    the challenged law is purportedly intended to serve."I think it is important to say that because I
                    think there has beena misimpression that the reasonable basis test is a weak test. It isweak only in
                    the area of economic distinctions. It is not weak inthe area of race or gender or other persons.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, the reasonable basis test is probably appliedin both. It is just that
                    the difference between races is irrelevant,and, therefore, distinctions may not be made. In
                    discussing thiswith Senator DeConcini, I mentioned that, for example, things thatyou would not allow
                    in a race case, you might allow, you wouldallow in a gender case; such as different toilet
                    facilities, differenceabout going into combat and so forth.Now, that makes my point. There are very
                    few areas in which adistinction between men and women is allowable, and those areamong the few. But
                    that distinction would not be allowable on thebasis of race.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Oh, that is quite true, Senator Thurmond. I madethe same point just a minute
                    ago, that the substantive due processapproach, which is equivalent in its legislative capacity by
                    judges,to a free form equal protection analysis is capable, as it was inDred Scott v. Sanford, of
                    producing horrible results, just as it is capableof producing what some would regard enlightened
                    results.When you hand this power to judges, if you allow this power tojudges, you have no guarantee
                    that the judges will always producewhat we or any number of us would like. Judges, once they beginto
                    put their personal preferences into law, may come up withdreadful results, as they did in Dred Scott
                    and as they did in theearly 1930s when they were striking down reform legislation.Let me say
                    something about why I prefer a reasonable basisanalysis to a group-by-group analysis. It is not just
                    that the languageof the amendment refers to "any person," therefore all persons.It is that if one
                    thing is clear about the 14th amendment, it isthat the framers of that amendment, the people who
                    ratified it,had no intention of wiping out distinctions between men andwomen that we would now
                    regard as very discriminatory. Theywent ahead and did it.So if you say group by group are women
                    included or not, youhave a hard time, as a matter of the intention of the people whopassed that, of
                    saying women as a group are included. But we havebeen using a reasonable basis test as a means for
                    implementing thebroad language of the equal protection clause now for all of thiscentury. I think it
                    makes more sense in this sense.I said in this case of Oilman y. Evans that we talked about, thatthe
                    Constitution evolves as society changes. I said that about thefirst amendment and its relation to
                    libel actions, but it is also truehere. Distinctions that we made between genders in the 19th
                    centuryand which we assumed to be reasonable then, or the society assumedto be reasonable then, no
                    longer seem to anybody to be reasonable.And those distinctions are beginning to fall. I think
                    theyare beginning to fall because the place of women in society hasevolved rapidly and changed
                    rapidly, and now we see only a fewdistinctions that may reasonably and rationally be made betweenmen
                    and women. And I have mentioned two. Some people saythose are extreme cases, and they certainly are.
                    Only extremecases in this area can be justified.</p>

                    would afford women constitutionalprotection against invidious discrimination. I think youhave
                    already very eloquently explained your reasoning. Your approach,as I understand it, would afford
                    equal protection to all personsunder the 14th amendment.Generally, your approach is more in line
                    with Justice John PaulStevens' rationale. Justice Stevens has written, "A reasonable basistest would
                    not lead to results very different from those under theCourt's current analysis. For example, one
                    need not employ a complexintermediate scrutiny test to determine whether a particulargender
                    classification is reasonable. Although all-male combat unitsmay be reasonable, disabilities based on
                    outmoded stereotypes arenot."The Supreme Court's decision in Rostiker v. Goldberg upholdingthe
                    all-male draft registration appears to confirm this conclusion.Do you think your approach would
                    protect women's right as adequatelyas they are protected now? And would you explain youranswer.</p>

                    and I explained my answer by much ofwhat I have just said; that rational distinctions cannot be made
                    betweenmen and women, usually, except on physical strength orsomething of that sort, which is the
                    combat example. It is rationalto have all-male combat troops. But in the ordinary occupations oflife
                    and in social intercourse and so forth and so on, there is norational distinction between men and
                    women.I think the Supreme Court has about arrived at that decisionusing intermediate scrutiny and so
                    forth. I arrive at it, as JusticeJohn Paul Stevens does, using a reasonable basis test. Is there
                    areasonable basis for a distinction?Most of the distinctions that survive in the law are old
                    onesmade long ago which no longer seem to reasonable to us. They arenot reasonable. In a different
                    state of culture, in a different state ofsociety, they may have seemed reasonable. They are not now.

                    Court standard of pornography.If the State's classification and the Supreme Court's are inaccord,
                    then the individuals concerned are not entitled to judicialintervention. However, I think confusion
                    arises because of thecharacterization to protect judicial intervention. I think somepeople view this
                    characterization as a Court declining to make ajudgment on whether protections of the first
                    amendment extend tocertain materials.I think what you are saying is the Supreme Court or lower
                    courtmust review the material itself and then make the determinationwhether the materials are, in
                    fact, pornographic; and if they arepornographic, they do not get first amendment protection. If
                    theyare not pornographic, they may be entitled to first amendment protection.Would you again please
                    clarify your position on this subject?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Yes. The Supreme Court has repeatedly said thatthere are some categories of
                    speechâ€”a very fewâ€”which are simplyoutside first amendment protection. They have mentioned
                    obscenity;they have mentioned fighting words, words that are likely tostart a fight; and a few
                    others.Now, in order to make sure that the first amendment is beingcomplied with, when a State
                    punishes words as obscenity or asfighting words or any other category, the Supreme Court has tolook,
                    or some court has to look and say, Did the State correctlyclassify those words as obscenity or as
                    fighting words under theconstitutional standard? If the State did not, then the SupremeCourt should
                    reverse the conviction and say you may not punishthat speech.But it is for the Supreme Court to
                    define what is obscenity andthe Supreme Court to define what is fighting words, and to ask ineach
                    case, Did the State correctly act against those words, or did itincorrectly act against those
                    words?I trust I make myself clear on this point, but I am not sure. All Iam saying is that the
                    ultimate control of the definitions and categoriesof words must be in the Supreme Court, not in the
                    State, ifthe first amendment is to be upheld.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, the views I expressed in 1971â€”it was a badyear. The views I
                    expressed in 1971 and Justice Holmes' clear andpresent test, I think that the Brandenburg case falls
                    somewhere inbetween that.Now, let me explain. I think that I have been getting criticismfirst
                    because I never change my mind; now I am being criticizedbecause I change my mind. And I want to
                    explain where I standabout this so that I can be criticized on the right grounds.There is only one
                    difference between what I said about advocacyof law violation and the Brandenburg position. I am not
                    talkingabout here somebody advocating violating the law in order to testits constitutionality. I am
                    not talking about the Martin LutherKing case; because if you advocate the violation of law in order
                    totest its constitutionality, certainly the speech is protected if thelaw is unconstitutional. It
                    may well be protected if the law is unconstitutional.I do not know where the law stands on that
                    rightnow.I am talking about the advocacy of law violation which is not relatedto a claim of
                    unconstitutionality in any way.I had really said, I did say that I thought theoretically the
                    advocacyof law violation in such circumstances could have been punishedunder the first amendment.
                    What Brandenburg did was saythere must be a closer nexus between the advocacy and the lawlessaction.
                    It said the advocacy of law violation must be in circumstanceswhere there is the likelihood of
                    imminent lawless action.So it added one factor to what I said, the closeness of the danger.Now, I
                    have not changed my mind about what I said upon thissubject. I could have accepted a first amendment
                    law that developedthe way I thought in 1971 it ought to have from the beginning.I could accept
                    that.The law did not develop that way. It developed to require acloser nexus between the advocacy
                    and the violent action or thelawless action, imminent lawless action. That is a change in thething,
                    but it does not involve me changing my mind at all. I canaccept either position.I accept the fact
                    that the Supreme Court has added an additionalsafeguard to the position that I took in 1971 for
                    speech advocatinglawlessness. As an academic, I thought that was not theoreticallyjustified. As a
                    judge, I accept it, and that is all there is to that.I think you will see that I have no trouble
                    with a strong readingof the first amendment from my court of appeals record, which ismore relevant,
                    I think, than speculations in the past.In any event, there is not that much difference between my
                    pastposition and the decision in Brandenburg.</p>

                    re-read the case, recently, but I remember, it isin Crandall y. Nevada, a couple of years before the
                    14th amendmentwas ratified.Nevada was taxing people a dollar every time they left the State,and the
                    Supreme Court struck down that tax in saying there was aright to travel without hindrance by the
                    State, and it did so onstructural reasoning about the nature of the Federal Union, andhow you have
                    to travel, and so forth.But the oldest example of structural reasoning in the lawâ€”I donot know if
                    it is the oldest, but the bestâ€”is Chief Justice JohnMarshall's opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland,
                    where entirely onstructural grounds, he first establishes the right of the UnitedStates to create a
                    national bank, the Bank of the United States,and then establishes that that bank must be free from
                    State taxationof its commercial instruments. An entirely structural argument,entirely sound
                    argument.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, the framers of the Constitution
                    recognized the uncheckedpowers of the executive branch of government as perhapsthe greatest threat
                    to liberty. That is what the fight for independencewas all about. They did not want another King
                    George, andthey certainly did not want an all-powerful President.One of the ways in which the
                    Constitution protects our freedomis by dividing the powers of government among the
                    threebranchesâ€”the President, the Congress, and the Courtsâ€”and ensuringthat each branch is in a
                    position to check any abuses by theothers. That is what the checks and balances are all about.First,
                    I would like to talk about the War Powers Act. When theCongress passed that legislation in 1973, a
                    very broad bipartisanmajority of the House and Senate expressed the view, in the wakeof Vietnam,
                    that no President should ever again be able to lead thecountry into an undeclared war without the
                    approval of Congress.Judge Bork, that was passed over President Nixon's veto by avote of 75 to 18 in
                    the Senate of the United States.Isn't it true, that in an article in "The Wall Street Journal,"
                    in1978, you stated that the War Powers Act wasâ€”and I quoteâ€”"probably unconstitutional, and
                    certainly unworkable?"Since then, have you expressed any different view about the WarPowers Act?</p>

                    am going to take it back. I am just going toclarify it.That was a sentence leading into a different
                    topic, and I do notrecall whether I have ever made any extensive analysis of the WarPowers Act.But
                    there are certainly problems with workability, and I do nottoday recall all the details, but a lot
                    of Presidents, and so forth,have complained about aspects of it.I remember when President Fordâ€”I
                    think it was the Mayaguezepisodeâ€”and in order to notify the Speaker of the House he had tocall him
                    where he was, in China, flying on a Chinese airliner, totell him about a military action. It seemed
                    a little odd, but I do notreally care about that. Those are policy questions, and they are notfor
                    me.When I say it was probably unconstitutional, that is a very complexact, and let me say, I think
                    the consultation requirementsprobably seem constitutional to me. The notice requirement
                    seemsconstitutional. But you know, that act, as I recall, contains a legislativeveto. I may be
                    wrong, but I think it contains a legislativeveto, which, at the time, I thought was probably
                    unconstitutional,and the Supreme Court in the Chadha case has since said that it
                    isunconstitutional.So that, I do not think, to that degree mine was a bad prediction.If I had to
                    construe the statuteâ€”and I do not know that I ever willbecause there are problems with
                    justiciability, and I do not knowthe answer to the justiciability problems but they are there.I
                    would construe it in order to save its constitutionality as anyjudge should.There is one other area
                    of possible problems with theact, and that is this. The major questions of war, or peace, or
                    questionsaffecting that, are most certainly for the Congress. Only Congresscan declare war.In fact
                    the Congress need not give the President a single soldier.There is no constitutional requirement
                    that it do so.But at the other end of the spectrum, tactical decisions in thefield seem to me to be
                    for the Commander in Chief, and, for example,I wouldâ€”to take the extreme caseâ€”I would have very
                    muchdoubted that during the Battle of the Bulge, Congress could haveordered the President to
                    surrender the airborne troops at Bastonnerather than continuing the battle.Now there is a vasi
                    spectrum between the ultimate strategicquestion of war or peace and tactical decisions in the field,
                    and itmay be that some constructions of the War Powers Act might getCongress into clearly tactical
                    decisions, but I am not sure aboutthat. I have not looked at that for a long time.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Of course your article in The Wall StreetJournal does not relate to the
                    legislative veto and there are manyother provisions in the War Powers Act itself.In 1971, you
                    suggested that it was unconstitutional for Congressto stop the President from invading Cambodia. We
                    all agree thatthe President is the Commander in Chief, and the Congress cannotmanage and should not
                    manage military tactics. That was veryclear during the hearings, and during the debate on the
                    WarPowers Act. We cannot run a war, but we ought to be able to stopa war. That is just common sense
                    in a democracy, and the Americanpeople have learned, with good reason, to be skeptical of
                    presidentialwars.We all know what happened in Vietnam, and the same concernswere there when
                    President Reagan sent the troops into Lebanon,and the American people are obviously concerned today
                    in regardto our policy in Nicaragua as well as the Persian Gulf.So the War Powers Act simply insures
                    that the President has thesupport of Congress and the country for these sorts of military
                    actions,but you say the Congress does not have any such power inthis absolutely vital area of war
                    and peace.You say it is unconstitutional and you say it is unworkable.</p>

                    Congress in 1978 by 95 to 1, tocorrect some of the abuses by the FBI and the Central
                    IntelligenceAgency during the Nixon administration.It requires that a warrant be obtained from a
                    special federalcourt before electronics surveillance can be conducted on UnitedStates citizens in
                    the course of a national security investigation. Itcontained an exception for a limited number of
                    top-secret wiretapsby the President.In June 1978, you testified before the House Judiciary

                <p class="short_transcript">I do not recall that I have, Senator, but let me explainthat view.We are
                    talking now about electronic surveillance of people wehave good reason to believe are agents of a
                    foreign power. EveryPresident since Franklin Roosevelt has claimed the power toengage in electronic
                    surveillance of foreign agents without a courtwarrant. Every President has claimed it.In addition to
                    that, the United States has won two court cases atthe court of appeals level. In the fifth circuit,
                    the court of appealsupheld a warrantless electronic surveillance against a foreignpower.In the third
                    circuit, the court sitting, en baneâ€”that is the fullcourt, not just three judgesâ€”the court
                    sitting, en bane, said thePresident had the constitutional power to engage in electronic
                    surveillanceof a foreign agent without a warrant.When I was Solicitor General, we had the Butenko
                    case which involveda Soviet KGB agent who was caught through electronic surveillancewithout a
                    warrant, and I knew we had won this case intwo lower courts, that the President's power included
                    that.So when Butenkoâ€”I think it was called Ivanov by that timeâ€”when he petitioned for
                    certiorari, having lost in the lower court, Itold the Supreme Court that I had no objection to the
                    Court takingthe case because I wanted to get a Supreme Court ruling on thePresident's power to
                    conduct electronic surveillance against foreignagents without warrants.We had been winning those
                    cases in the courts, and that is why Ithought it was the prerogative that every President since
                    FranklinRoosevelt had claimed. That is the article II point, Senator.The article III point is this.
                    Article III requires that the judicialpower be used where there is a case, or a controversy. In the
                    ordinarywarrant case, you certainly have the potential for a case or acontroversy because the judge
                    or a magistrate issues a warrant.If any arrest, or anything goes wrong, or damage occurs in
                    theexecution of that warrant, that warrant may be challenged incourt.What troubled me about this new
                    warrant procedure was that itis a secret court. There is no challenge to challenge the
                    procedureunless somebody is arrested, which may not be the case becauseyou are just surveilling for
                    intelligence purposesâ€”there is no challenge to the procedure and you have got a body of secret law
                    growingup, that nobody knows about except the judges on the courtand the Government people who go to
                    talk to that court.That worried me, under Article III of the Constitution. I was notsure that was a
                    judicial function.</p>

                    limit surveillance of U.S. citizens.The fact is we have had that on the law books now for a number
                    ofyears.Judge William Webster, who is now the Director of the CIA, alsothe former Director of the
                    FBI, when he was questioned aboutwhether he believed it was any hindrance in terms of trying
                    tofollow or surveil foreign agents, subversives, those that might betreasonous to the United States,
                    said that the actâ€”and I quoteâ€”"worked beautifully."Obviously that particular law is an important
                    safeguard now. Ithink of the administration's opposition to the sanctuary movementfor refugees from
                    El Salvadorâ€”we are talking about Americancitizens now. We certainly do not want Ed Meese
                    runningaround with unlimited power to put wiretaps on churches.You seem to feel that the law
                    infringes on the national securitypower of the President, but the Congress did not think the
                    Presidenthas any inherent power to violate the privacy of Americancitizens in the name of national
                    security, and I do not think thatthe President has any such power</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Let's talk about another area. That is the roleof special prosecutors.Many
                    of us in Congress and the country are troubled by chargesin the Iran-Contra scandal that officials
                    in the executive branchbroke the law and ignored statutes enacted by the Congress prohibitingU.S.
                    military aid to the contras in Nicaragua. It seemsfundamental to the rule of law, that the President
                    must obey thesame laws that bind every other American. No President, no official,is above the
                    law.And after the unsatisfactory experience with Watergate, particularlyyour firing of Special
                    Prosecutor Archibald Cox, Congress enacteda law so that special prosecutors could be appointed by
                    thecourts, with their independence guaranteed.In November 1973, a few weeks after you fired Mr. Cox,
                    you testified,The question is whether congressional legislation appointing a special
                    prosecutoroutside the executive branch, or empowering the courts to do so, would be
                    constitutionallyvalid, and whether it provides significant advantages that make it worthtaking a
                    constitutionally risky course.I am persuaded that such a course would almost certainly not be valid,
                    andwould, in any event, pose more problems than it would solve.Would you tell the committee whether
                    you have ever publicly expresseda different view regarding the constitutionality of the
                    specialprosecutor legislation.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I was just going to repeat what I said back in 1973,because for one
                    thingâ€”and I think those proposals were very differentstatutes than the one that is now in effect.
                    They contemplatedjudicial appointment and judicial control, and judicial terminationof the special
                    prosecutor. The present one does not.I was complaining about control of the prosecutor by the
                    courts,which I think is right. Also, the question arose in those hearingswhether Congress could, by
                    statute, protect a special prosecutor, sohe could only be fired for cause.And as I recall what I
                    said thenâ€”and I do not, heeding the warninggiven me by Senator Thurmond, I am just repeating what
                    Isaid thenâ€”was that Congress probably could protect the specialprosecutor from discharge except
                    for cause, if that special prosecutorwas a subordinate official, that is, somebody appointed by
                    theAttorney General, rather than somebody appointed by the Presidentand confirmed by the Senate,
                    because the case law seems tosuggest that the President has much more power over an officialhe
                    appoints and the Senate confirms, than he does over a subordinateofficial appointed by a department
                    head. So I made that distinctionback then.</p>

                    that is even now before the Court,but I think it is fair for us to draw certain conclusions from
                    thestatements that you made in 1973, your last statements withregard to it, particularly since you
                    have been so involved in thewhole question of special prosecutors.Moving to another area, I would
                    like to ask you about congressionalstanding to bring law suits challenging abuses of the
                    Constitutionby the President.Obviously, as in the case of the War Powers Act, Congress cannotrun the
                    executive branch, and we cannot take the President intocourt every time we disagree with a policy of
                    the administration.But that is not the issue. In a few very important situations, membersof Congress
                    should have the right to resort to the courts topreserve the constitutional role of Congress. That
                    is what we callthe doctrine of congressional standing, the right of members ofCongress to sue in the
                    courts.In a dissenting opinion in 1985, is it not true you said, and Iquote, "We ought to renounce
                    outright the whole notion of congressionalstanding"? Then you went on to state in that opinion, and
                    Iquote,When Federal courts approach the brink of general supervision of Government, asthey do here,
                    the eventual outcome may even be more calamitous than the loss ofjudicial protection of our
                    liberties.Since you issued that opinion, have you expressed any differentview?</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">No, I have not. Perhaps I should explain a little bitabout that.The doctrine
                    of congressional standing, as you and I know, Senator,but perhaps not everybody listening to us
                    knows, is the theorythat if the President does not enforce the law the way Congressthinks it
                    intended the law to be enforced, a Congressman may sueto get an injunction or a declaratory judgment
                    against the Presidentto make him do what the Congressman wants him to do.That is an entirely novel
                    constitutional doctrine which I thinkwas never heard of before 1974 in the case you brought, Kennedy
                    v.Sampson and it is confined to the circuit court on which I sit. I donot think any other circuit
                    has ever picked up that doctrine. So itis a constitutional novelty, and it is by no means settled.
                    And theSupreme Court has not passed upon it.The reason I am troubled by it as follows: What it will
                    lead to is,I think, other domination of the Government by the judiciary. If aCongressman has
                    something akin to a property interest or somethingin the law he passes, if it is not carried out
                    properly, so thathis official capacity is in some sense diminished, then I think thePresident has an
                    equal interest in not being forced to do things heregards as improper or unconstitutional.
                    Therefore, if Congressmenmay sue the President because he is not doing something under thelaw they
                    would like, if the Congress overrides a presidential vetoand the President thinks that cuts into his
                    constitutional office toomuch, the President can sue the Congress.For example, I spent some time as
                    Solicitor General trying to geta case on the legislative veto. I wanted to see whether that thingwas
                    constitutional. If I had understood the theory of congressionalstanding, which is really
                    governmental standing, I could havestopped hunting for a case. I could just have had the President
                    suethe Congress and get a declaration right away.But if it is true of a President and Congress, it
                    is also true ofjudges. If Congress passes a statute that I think cuts into mypowers, I can go to the
                    Supreme Court for a declaration of unconstitutionally.In fact, that happened. Two judges in the
                    NorthernDistrict of Illinois were reversed by the seventh circuit, and thejudges petitioned for
                    certiorari to the Supreme Court on thegrounds that the seventh circuit had done things to their
                    officewhich were improper.Everybody is going to be in the federal court defining their rightsof
                    office instantly. What is important to remember about congressionalstanding is it is not the only
                    way you can get those issuesbefore the Court. If the President does something that is not in
                    accordancewith the law, there is almost always a private individualwho can sue and who can show
                    injury; and he can then challengethe President's action, which is exactly what happened in the
                    oldpocket veto cases.</p>

                    we would find each of the various respectivebranches suing the others, because the speech and
                    debateclause forbids lawsuits against members of Congress for actions intheir official capacity. For
                    any speech or debate in either House,they shall not be questioned in any other place. Judges under
                    theStump v. Sparkman decision are immune from suit for decisionsthey make.Congressional standing may
                    not always be appropriate, but itclearly is appropriate when the President unconstitutionally
                    claimsa duly enacted law is not a law at all. I think we are not openingthe floodgates by giving
                    Congress the power to go into court in anarrow range of cases where the President has abused his
                    powerand denied the rights of Congress under the Constitution. You saythat the Congress cannot even
                    raise the question in court becausethat sort of litigation would open up the doors to all sorts of
                    otherabuses. I believe that is just another example of your attempt todraw a bright line that just
                    does not make any sense. In</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I will just finish this thought, and whatevercomment you have, obviously we
                    would welcome.In recent years, a number of Senators and Congressmen of bothparties thought the
                    President was not acting in accord with theConstitution. They tried to take the administration to
                    court. Ithink Barry Goldwater would be surprised to hear that you did notthink he had standing to
                    challenge President Carter on the TaiwanDefense Treaty. I think Jesse Helms would be surprised to
                    hearthat you do not think he had standing to challenge PresidentCarter on the Panama Canal Treaty.
                    Many other Senators havefiled actions in federal courts, including Senator Melcher,
                    SenatorMetzenbaum, Senator Pressler, Senator Proxmire, Senator Riegle,Senator Trible and others.The
                    issue has nothing to do with the merits of the cases. Thepoint is, Mr. Bork, you seem to think that
                    the members of Congressare in these instances second-class citizens. You close the courthousedoor on
                    all of us, and we never get our day in court.</p>

                    Goldwater would not be surprisedto learn that I have these views, because when he broughtthat case
                    about the Panama Canal, some of the lawyers workingwith him called me about my involvement. And I
                    said, "I do notthink you have standing." And they never called back. So he willnot be surprised to

                <p class="short_transcript">Just to summarize, Judge Bork, the Americanpeople rely on the Congress to
                    protect them from abuses of powerby the executive branch. But, Judge Bork, whenever Congress
                    hastried to curb abuses, you always seem to side with the President.You broke the law in Watergate
                    when you obeyed President Nixonand fired Archibald Cox. You have testified that
                    court-appointedspecial prosecutors are unconstitutional, which suggests that youwould let the
                    administration investigate itself when corruption isthe issue.You oppose limits on the national
                    security power of the President,even when the issue is wire-tapping and eavesdropping onAmerican
                    citizens. Those cases you mentioned did not address theconstitutionality of the act.You believe that
                    Congress can never use the courts to challengethe President when he abuses his power.You wrote that
                    the WarPowers Act was probably unconstitutional. You suggested that Congresshas no power to stop the
                    President from taking us into awider war in Vietnam. And that same reasoning would apply tosending
                    U.S. military aid to the contras in Nicaragua or even sellingthe arms to the Ayatullah in Iran.The
                    Constitution calls for checks and balances. You seem to feelthat when it comes to the relation
                    between Congress and the President, instead of checks and balances the President has a blankcheck
                    and the Congress exerts no balance at all.You say you believe in the original intent, Mr. Bork, but
                    theFounding Fathers certainly did not intend an all-powerful President.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator Kennedy, I must say I think those are mostunfair characterizations
                    of my views. Let me startâ€”I hardly knowwhere to start.In your case, when you challenged President
                    Nixon's pocket veto,and that pocket veto was held unconstitutional by the D.C. Circuit,I did not
                    take certiorari because I thought the D.C. Circuit was correct.When the Ford administration began to
                    use a combinationreturn veto and pocket veto, I announced that that was incorrect,and I would not
                    argue their case in the Supreme Court.I then prepared a lengthy analysis of the constitutionality of
                    thepocket veto and concluded against the President, which I sent toAttorney General Levi.He sent it
                    to the White House with a notationthat he agreed with my analysis and that I would not arguethe case
                    if they had to go to the Supreme Court, which would be aclear signal that the Solicitor General
                    disagreed with him.I concluded in that analysis that when Congress adjourns andleaves behind an
                    officer to receive a return veto, which is quite differentin its consequences from a pocket veto,
                    the President may berequired to use a return veto and not a pocket veto, because thatwas the
                    original understanding, so far as I could tell, of the pocketveto clause.That is an example where I
                    sided with Congress against thePresident when I was in the executive branch.Now, you said a number
                    of other things, that I broke the law inWatergate. I said yesterday that I did not break the law in
                    Watergate.There is no existing court opinion that says I did, and I gaveSenator Metzenbaum the
                    reasons why I thought I did not breakthe law in that case. And I should say, I was not in Watergate.
                    Icame down here June 27th of 1973. I did not even know the principalcharacters in that. I have never
                    met them.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, I have sat through hours and
                    hours of these hearingswith you. I personally want to compliment you because I thinkthat on this
                    particular day, September 17, 1987, 200 years of historyand the Constitution, I think you have done
                    as much as anybodyelse or any program on television or any commentator to talkabout the viability of
                    our Constitution and how it works and howgreat minds help it work than anybody else will today. I
                    think it isa very historic occasion to have you sitting here in front of thiscommittee answering
                    these very, very technical and difficult questions.Over the last three days, you have taken some of
                    the toughestissues I have ever seen, and you answered them with aplomb, withcredibility, no question
                    with erudition, and no question within themainstream of the law of this country, or any law
                    anywhere.I find it kind of interesting that Senator Kennedy's questionsranged from the War Powers
                    Actâ€”and I thought you made it veryclear what some of the real discrepancies and problems are
                    withregard to that particular bill; the Foreign Intelligence SurveillanceAct, you could not have
                    given a better explanation off the top ofyour head than you did on that; the Special Prosecutors or
                    IndependentCounsel Act, the question of standingâ€”very, very difficult,complex constitutional and
                    legal issues.Once again, we heard Senator Kennedy suggest that you brokethe law when you followed
                    President Nixon's order to fire ArchibaldCox. Now, that is false. No court opinion remains valid
                    today,or even remains on the book, that says that you have broken thelaw. In fact, to the contrary.
                    A single federal judge who was caughtup in the momentous events of that occasion basically said
                    somethingto that effect, and his opinion was vacated. I think SenatorKennedy knows that. That is why
                    you were right when you said hewas being unfair in some of these characterizations. And I onlychoose
                    that one unfair statement to bring to the attention of youand our public out there.That case is a
                    nullity. It was erased. It was wiped off. It is zip asfar as the laws of this land is concerned. It
                    was so fallacious that ithad to be erased. As a matter of fact, the people who asked for it tobe
                    erased were the plaintiffs. You wanted the case to be appealedas far as I know.</p>

                    anybody, whether you are trained in thelaw or not, would not be impressed with the way you have
                    handledthese very intricate, difficult questions. And you have done it offthe top of your head.
                    There is hardly anybody in this country thatcan do that.It is difficult for me to understand why the
                    furor about yournomination here. It ought to be automatic, just as your nominationwas approved and
                    confirmed to the second most important court inthis country, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
                    District of Columbia.I wonder why 5 years later all of a sudden you are in a contesthere, and I
                    think the people out there are wondering too. If theyreally look behind it and they see some of
                    these unjust accusationsand some of these unjust characterizations, some of these rabid,radical
                    groups out there trying to destroy a reputation that hasbeen built very, very well over many, many
                    years, I think they aregoing to be a disgusted as I am, and I hope they are getting thatpoint.Let me
                    go to some specifics, though. We have been talking abouta number of civil rights cases and in
                    particular I would like todwell on the Katzenbach v. Morgan case, the 1966 case. That iswhere the
                    Supreme Court upheld a Congressional statute that redefined the words of the Constitution itself as
                    I view it. Is that afair characterization?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, let me make two points about that, Senator.In 1803 Chief Justice John
                    Marshall decided the case of Marbury v.Madison in which he for the first time gave an extensive
                    rationalefor the power of the judiciary to strike down statutes. Central tohis reasoning was the
                    fact that the Constitution would be meaninglessif Congress could alter it by a mere
                    statute.Katzenbach v. Morgan is in direct conflict with that historic decisionbecause it did allow
                    Congress to alter a constitutional provisionby statute.The other point I want to make is this, when
                    I wrote suggestingtheâ€”not decidingâ€”but suggesting the constitutionality of thePresident's 1972
                    bill placing limitations on bussingâ€”not abolishingbussingâ€”placing some limitations on it, I
                    could easily have reliedupon Katzenbach v. Morgan if I were result oriented. In what Iwrote I
                    explicitly said, it is a bad decision, I will not rely upon it toget my ends.</p>

                    Constitution whichmust go to the States.</p>

                    course of constitutional interpretation.Let me just say, Justices Harlan and Stewart dissented from
                    thatdecision, saying it would be a, quote, "sacrifice of fundamentals inthe American constitutional
                    system, the separation between thelegislative and judicial function," unquote.Four years after
                    Katzenbach the Court refused to extend the doctrineto uphold the constitutionality of Congress'
                    attempt to lowerthe voting age from 21 to 18. So they refused to extend Katzenbach.That was in
                    Oregon v. Mitchell. And as a result of that, Congressthen did act pursuant to constitutional
                    authority, went to article Vand passed an amendment by the appropriate two-thirds vote andwent out
                    and got it ratified by three-quarters of the States andtoday 18-year-olds can vote. That is the
                    appropriate way to resolvethese matters. Not by mere statute.</p>

                    Mitchell, which said that Congress cannot justgo out and by statute use Katzenbach to allow
                    18-year-olds to votewithout going through the constitutional procedure that was required.In that
                    case Justices Burger, Stewart, Harlan, Black andBlackmun voted against the Katzenbach
                    principal.Moreover, Justice Powell cited Harlan's Katzenbach dissent withapproval in the City of
                    Rome case. Of course, that was a votingrights case and the very person you are to replace cited
                    those dissentsas reasonable.Now, he too endorsed the view that you have taken of this
                    particularcase, so once again you are in excellent company, eventhough your critics have tried to
                    distort what you have said in thisparticular area. So those who criticize your view it seems to me
                    itis incumbent upon them to also explain why they are criticizingJustices Harlan, Black, Burger,
                    Stewart, Blackmun and Powell.So when anybody says you are outside of the mainstream, then Isuspect
                    they are saying they are too.</p>

                    One distorted charge even alleged that youfind no basis for the rule that the federal government may

                    stopped on first amendment grounds.There was a statute in Meyer v. Nebraska which prohibited
                    theteaching of students in a foreign language, and I said that statutecould be invalidated on first
                    amendment grounds.It has been suggested to me, and I do not take a position on iteither way, that
                    Boiling v. Sharpe, which struck down the statutesegregating students on the basis of race, might

                    judge on the D.C. Circuit, my research indicates that you havenever advocated a position less
                    sympathetic to minority or femaleplaintiffs than that ultimately adopted by the Supreme Court
                    orJustice Powell.In other words, you have consistently been just a sympathetic ormore sympathetic to
                    civil rights than the current Supreme Courtand the justice that you would replace.Now, I realize
                    that the one exception to this rule would be caseswhere a federal law or policy was challenged under
                    civil rights law.In such cases, the Solicitor General is compelled to defend the legalityof
                    government actions, except in the most egregious cases.I realize that you may not have analyzed your
                    own record fromthis standpoint, but outside of your duties as Solicitor General, canyou think of a
                    single time where you as Solicitor General or as ajudge advocated a position less favorable to

                    of being insensitive to civil rightswhere you advocated more than the Supreme Court was willing
                    todo; and then later the Congress adopts your positionâ€”I might addwith my vote for it, out of my
                    committee. That is interesting.Congress passed the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1976, as Irecall,
                    to overturn the Supreme Court's restrictive rating in titleVII, and we really adopted the position
                    that you argued in theCourt at that time.Let me look at another example. Would you sketch the issue
                    inthe case of Washington v. Davis. That is a 1976 case where the disparateimpact on minorities
                    appeared with regard to written examinationsgiven to job applicants, if you recall that case.</p>

                    Powell has an excellent record. Yet inthese five cases I have just named, his actions were actually
                    lesssensitive to civil rights than yours, which I think flies in the face ofthe arguments against
                    you: that you are out of the mainstream;that you are going to upset the balance; that you are going
                    to hurtthe Court, et cetera, et cetera. And I think, again, it goes to someof the scurrilous things
                    that have been said about you that I thinkhave no basis whatsoever.Now, I think people could read
                    those five cases, and they couldconclude that Justice Powell was not in tune with the minorityneeds.
                    Just the opposite is true. You know it and I know it, yet wehave heard in one or two isolated
                    quotes, far less authoritativelythan those five votes that you did, that have been cited by the
                    oppositionto your record on a specific issue.I might just make one more comparison with the current
                    Justice.In the 19 amicus briefs you filed, friend-of-the-court briefs that youfiled as Solicitor
                    General, do you know which Justice who is still onthe Court sided with you most often?</p>

                    very little discretion unless the government'sposition is not intellectually respectable. And I have
                    confessederror in the Supreme Court when that was the case.But when he is filing an amicus brief, he
                    has more latitude todecide whether or not the position being taken is not just
                    intellectuallyrespectable, but really ought to prevail or come closeâ€”youknow, I do not mean ought
                    to prevail. It is kind of hard to state aprecise calibration of the degree of his latitude, but I
                    think whenhe is filing an amicus brief he has to be more in sympathy with theposition than he does
                    when he is defending a client.</p>

                    addressed yesterday, and I had nointention of returning to it today. But since I have heard
                    SenatorKennedy, Senator Hatchâ€”even somebody when I walked outside, amember of the mediaâ€”raise
                    the question of whether it is appropriateto question the illegality of an act that you did in view
                    of thefact that the decision was vacated, let me put that in my own context.That is the only ruling
                    of any court in connection with youraction, and that court decided that your action was illegal.
                    Now, itis a fact that thereafter you were precluded from having an opportunityto appeal that
                    decision because the case had become moot.There was no longer an issue before the court. That was
                    becauseArchibald Cox had gone back to Harvard; he had been replacedwith a new person.Under those
                    circumstances, Judge Bork, it seems to me that it isvery appropriate to point out the illegality of
                    that act. It is the onlycourtâ€”it is true you did not have a chance to appeal it. But I mustsay to
                    you that I still consider it to be a relevant matter in connectionwith this hearing.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, Senator, I think it is important when we sayan illegal act, the
                    illegal act was not illegal, and I will explain that,too. But the illegality, if one existed, was
                    merely that a regulationwas not rescinded before the discharge but afterwards. Now, that isnot a
                    matter of great moral turpitude because I could have rescindedthe regulation at any time.But the
                    reason I think it was not even technically illegal wasthat the cases relied upon by the district
                    court judge were cases inwhich a department head, like an Attorney General, had issued aregulation
                    and then had gone ahead on his own discretion and violatedit. In this case, the President gave me an
                    order to dischargeArchibald Cox which I think overrides an Attorney General's regulation.That is why
                    I think the action was legal.</p>

                    by the White House lawyers, by thePresident's lawyers, was that there was no jurisdiction in the
                    casebecause Mr. Jaworski was a subordinate official to the President,and the President could give
                    Mr. Jaworski an order. The court respondedthat as long as the regulation was in force, until the
                    Presidentrescinded the order, there was jurisdiction; but there was nodoubt that the President had
                    the power to rescind that charter. Infact, in the letter from the President to me that night, he
                    said,"You are to discharge Mr. Cox and abolish the office of specialprosecutor." The abolition of
                    the office was on paper only. Theoffice continued intact. But that was a presidential rescission of
                    theregulation.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I believe that the antitrust laws are nonpartisan.They first came into being
                    when John Sherman, a RepublicanSenator from my own State, authored the law. They havebeen in effect
                    for many years. They have been effectively enforcedby Republican and Democratic Presidents, and some
                    RepublicanPresidents were particularly strong in enforcing them.I believe the effective enforcement
                    of antitrust laws and thoseantitrust laws are important to the free enterprise system. I thinkit
                    makes competition work in this country. And I think competitionis important to the consumers of this
                    country, the people who go tothe store and buy something.What concerns me is that your position with
                    respect to antitrustis that somehow you are getting something called consumer welfare,and then you
                    have an economic efficiency, and that businesswill operate better, and somehow it will help the
                    consumers downbelow.What bothers me, Judge Bork, are those people in my State andthroughout the
                    country who are presently going to a store andbuying products at a discount price, at a competitive
                    price, and youwould take away the right of those retailers to compete; you wouldtake away the right
                    to keep competition in the country and permitonly two to three companies to operate in the whole
                    nation in anyparticular area.I am frank to say to you, you can write 460 pagesâ€”and they
                    aremarvelously writtenâ€”but the little guy out in Ohio, the littlewoman who is trying to buy
                    clothes for her children, or the personwho wants to buy a bicycle for their kids, they want to buy
                    it atthe cheapest possible price. And if we were to follow your theory ofthe law, they would not be
                    able to do so.</p>

                    question of what best serves consumers,what best serves consumer welfare. I have not made a single
                    argumentin this book which is not based upon that, and it could bethat I have made some arguments
                    which are wrong. I do not thinkthey were wrong when I wrote them. Economics continues to
                    advance.Maybe it will be shown that I am wrong in some respects. Iwould be very surprised if
                    eventually I am not wrong in some respectsbecause I do not pretend to have come to the end of
                    economictheory. In fact, I am simply an amateur economist. I was then; Iam not now.But everything in
                    that book is an argument from consumer welfare,including the argument that you refer to.Now, the
                    Supreme Court in the case of restraints upon dealers'competition has adopted part of my thesis since

                    like K-Mart or Toys "R Us or somediscounter is selling children's shoe at $25 and the
                    manufacturerwants them sold at $50, under your theory it would be entirelylawful for the
                    manufacturer to require the retailer to charge thehigher price. Now, that is price fixing, pure and
                    simple, and it hasbeen illegal since 1911.My question to you is, and I know you are profound in this
                    area.I know you studied this area. I know you are an authority on it.But the people in this country
                    who go and want to buy things atthe lowest possible priceâ€”and I conducted hearings on how
                    muchlower prices were in discount stores than the regular retail price,and it was amazing how little
                    people came in and said what itmeans to them to be able to buy a little piece of clothing for
                    theirchild for $6.95 instead of $10, or to buy a wheelbarrow or somethingfor their children at a
                    lower price, and those dollars mean somuch.Tell me in language that you and I can understand, and
                    theAmerican people can understand, how you can argue that pricefixing is going to help the consumer?

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, in the first place, Senator, I think it is essentialto distinguish
                    between price fixing between competitors, whichis illegal per se, meaning that it cannot be
                    justified on anygrounds. I have agreed emphatically with that rule. I think if competitorsfix prices
                    they should be punished. They should be sued fortreble damages. They should be criminally
                    prosecuted. No doubtabout it.We know why people fix prices; they want to make fatter profitsthan
                    they should get under competition. We are now shifting to thecase that you bring up, which is, say a
                    manufacturer who wants toset the minimum price at which his retailers can sell. In 1911 theDr. Miles
                    case examined the practice and said, we would not let thedealers fix the price themselves and
                    therefore it follows that weshould not let the manufacturer fix their price for them.That argument
                    does not follow. The manufacturer who is fixingthe price of the dealers has no reason in this world
                    to want to givethem a fatter profit. What he wants them to do, usually, is to competein a different
                    way; compete by providing information, competeby providing selling services, compete by adding
                    things to the product.Now, those are not bad activities and if he could own those dealershimself, or
                    if he owned them himself, he would probably sell atthe price he fixed and add those services. It is
                    merely a way ofdoing by contract what he could do if he owned them, and the purposeis to get these
                    people to compete in other ways and not belowa certain price.Now, that may be pro consumer or not.
                    It can be viewed as proconsumer because the manufacturer has no incentive. He is notgetting any
                    monopoly profit out of this. The manufacturer has noincentive to do that unless more consumers
                    respond to the particularbehavior of dealers that he encourages with that price limitation.Now, we
                    are into a kind of arcane area</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">But it is not arcane if you are a housewife.I took a survey in Cleveland and
                    it showed that consumersgenerally save up to a third at discount storesâ€”$450 a year onclothes,
                    nearly $60 a year on electronics, over $40 a year on toysfor the children. The Justice Department
                    has found that prior torepeal of Miller-Tydings in 1975, the so-called fair trade laws,prices were
                    nearly 30 percent higher, costing consumers billions ofdollars. That was their determination.As a
                    matter of fact, I have a pretty good ally on this particularissue, and that is, President Reagan
                    spoke out against fair tradelaws, saying they hurt consumers by keeping prices up. Do youthink that

                <p class="short_transcript">Manufacturers do not typically find it useful tomaintain prices on a product
                    like that. Let me give you an examplefrom real life. There was a time when you could set resale
                    priceson things like television and big appliances and so forth. And whenyou did that, a store like
                    Marshall Fields in Chicago would carrythe full line of the manufacturer's products so they could
                    show youevery one, and they would have a knowledgeable person there toexplain the differences and so
                    forth, because it paid them to dothat.Then, when resale price maintenance became impossible, a
                    discountstore opened up, and that is quite right. Prices dropped. Butpeople would come in and shop
                    at Marshall Fields, look at all themodels and get all the information and explanation, write downthe
                    model number, and go over to the discount store and buy it.That is fine, except what happens is,
                    Marshall Fields stopped supplyingthe information, showing all the models and so forth.Now, that cost
                    consumers, too. Some consumers want the informationand want the services and the manufacturer would
                    not putin resale price maintenance unless he thought more consumerswould respond to that package of
                    information services and so forththan would respond to a lower price. Because his only interest is
                    inselling as many as he can.Now, I may be wrong about resale price maintenance. That wasthe analysis
                    I went through in 1978. There may be new information.As I understand itâ€”I have not been reading
                    the economic literaturesinceâ€”as I understand it, there is new economics abouttransaction costs,
                    costs of providing information and so forth. Itmay conceivably alter my view if that is brought to
                    my attention.I am giving you the line of argument I followed in 1978.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">All right. In about 1978 or 1979, after the Sylvaniacase came down allowing
                    a manufacturer to divide his dealers territoriesâ€”which is market division, which has the same
                    effect asprice fixingâ€”I then wroteâ€”that is, the Supreme Court is somewhatinconsistent in
                    allowing market division of dealers' territories sothey cannot compete but not allowing setting the
                    dealers' prices sothey cannot compete on priceâ€”but be that as it may, the SupremeCourt has reached
                    that.Now, it may be, as I wrote in that article in the "Supreme CourtReview"â€”I think it was, 1978
                    or 1979â€”that Congress' repeal of theMiller-Tydings Act and the other act, whose name escapes me
                    atthe moment, should be taken as Congress' will that the Court notallow resale price maintenance.I
                    suggested that in that article. I said, that may be the way itshould go. But if that is the case,
                    then the Supreme Court shouldsay, we do not feel free to revise the rule as to resale price
                    maintenancesbecause we think Congress has indicated something withits repeal of the Miller-Tydings
                    Act. But I said they should saythat.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I can give you every assurance, but it will have tobe according to my
                    understanding of what the law means and whatthe economics means.Let me go back. In the Sherman Act,
                    which is the act we aretalking about, which merely says that restraints of trade are illegal,the
                    Congress rather clearly gave a mandate to the courts toevolve the rules that would protect
                    competition. And Senator Shermansaid as much. He said he was really aiming at three classes
                    ofcasesâ€”in his speech on the floor of the Senateâ€”he was aiming atprice fixing between
                    competitors, he was aiming at monopolisticmergers, and he was aiming at predatory conduct by a firm
                    whichprevented competitors from competing effectively.Beyond that he said, the courts will have to
                    evolve the rules toprotect consumers from time to time. In the great 1911 cases ofStandard Oil and
                    American Tobacco, written by Chief JusticeWhite, he explicitly said that these statutes are aimed at
                    practiceswhich restrict output. He gave three categories of cases.</p>

                    the elementary and indisputable concepts of thecommon law about hurting competition. And he built
                    into the ruleof reason, which he announced in that case, a mechanism for evolvingthe law as economic
                    understanding progresses. That is quiteclear in the legislative history of the Sherman Act. It is
                    quite clearin the great rule of reason cases, Standard Oil and American Tobacco.That is all I have

                    I conclude today about largecorporate mergers. Today we meet here with an unprecedentedwave of
                    mergers. And from your writings I get the impression thatthis greater concentration of power in
                    large corporations does notdisturb you.It disturbs this Senator and I think it disturbs many people
                    inthis country. In fact, you have written that such trends are desirableand should be allowed to
                    continue until there are only two companies.That is the "Antitrust Paradox" at page 205 and 206,
                    yourbook on this subject.I quote: "We are in an area of uncertainty when we ask whethermergers that
                    would concentrate a market to only two firms ofroughly equal size should be prohibited. My guess is
                    they shouldnot. And therefore, that mergers up to 60 or 70 percent of themarket should be
                    permitted."From this I can only conclude that you would look favorably on amerger which left only
                    two firms in the oil industry or the airlineindustry, the food industry or any other industry. I
                    think at onepoint you said that maybe there ought to be three, but it does notmatter to me whether
                    it is two or three.</p>

                    this free enterprise system,as I said earlier, and if we were to follow your line of reasoningthere
                    will not be any competition in this country because two companieswill not effectively compete
                    against each other. It will sortof be a laissez-faire approach where they will let each do their

                    not. TheCongress' statutes have been most imprecise about the size of allowablemergers. Section 7 of
                    the Clayton Act, which is the primarystatute dealing with mergers, just says, stop it if it may
                    tendtowards a monopoly or to lessen competition. It does not say anythingabout what market share
                    should be allowed.If you look at the legislative history, you cannot find out whatmarket share
                    should be allowed. If Congress has an economictheory and says, no fewer than 10, no fewer than 20

                    compiled a number of these statementson various issues and I would like to ask that a
                    compilationthat he made be made a part of the record for the hearings, and Iam sure as the
                    questioning continues Mr. Bork will have furtheropportunity to explain these and other statements
                    that he hasmade on the public record during his career. He will have an opportunityto explain these
                    later.</p>

                    get Senator Simpson back hereâ€”istry to get three, maybe four more people. The problem I have
                    isthat Mr. Shevardnadze is here and is going to brief all Senators,and obviously that is an
                    important matter.I am not sure, until my colleagues get back, what their wish willbe, whether to
                    continue with a questioner while Shevardnadze ishere. We will make that judgment when they get
                    back.But if we went with four more people today, that would leavefour for a second round tomorrow,
                    and you do not have to answernow, but I would like you to consider maybe starting a little
                    earliertomorrow morning, maybe start at 9:30, 9:00 o'clock even, I do notknow.</p>

                <strong>Alan K. Simpson</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">NOW I was interested this morning by membersof the panel discussing things
                    with Judge Bork. I still am puzzledhow we can rag around that one on the decision, the Court
                    decisionon Watergate, when it was vacated, and I do not know how muchmore you could really milk that
                    one.A vacated court decision is just that—null, void, repealed, out thewindow, gone. And that is
                    what was proven to be so. And then Ireally do not know how, really, we can blame every social ill
                    uponyou that has befallen our country in these last years, and I thinkthat that is easily perceived
                    for what it is.I personally want to tell you, I do not think you were responsiblefor the Vietnam
                    War. I want to tell you that, and I feel thatdeeply.Or every failure of the marketplace.
                    Capitalism's little ups anddowns, I am not going to lay at your feet.So, I think we should kind of
                    keep our eye on the rabbit here,that we are trying to confirm a Supreme Court Justice, and we
                    aredoing that, and very seriously so, and I say that on behalf of all ofus. It has been very
                    interesting to me to hear some rather stirringdiscussions, very academic discussions from various
                    members of thepanel.It is as much of a revelation as almost being back in law school,and hearing the
                    debate of the sharpest kid in the class with thesharpest professor in the class, and I say that on
                    behalf of my colleagues,because on both sides of the aisle, these are some superblawyers.So that has
                    been interesting. Some of it has been rather arcane, Imight add, I have thought. It is not really
                    going to replace anyone'sdiet of viewing fare, in my mind, but the American people arehearing and
                    listening, and judging, judging you on how you handlethe questions, some very pungent, some very
                    absurd, some very appropriate,some very inappropriate.What has kind of been interesting to me is how
                    we are judgingthings you did by how we feel in America now, and not how peoplefelt about America
                    then, and that is so easy to do.These are different times than they were in 1964, at the time ofthe
                    Civil Rights Act. Different times than when the debate went onin the Senate.And the ultimate of
                    different times has been mentioned here twoor three times—the extraordinary situation of the removal
                    of theJapanese-Americans to camps in the United States. That has beenmentioned here several
                    times.Today, the House will pass that bill. I am a co-sponsor of thatbill, and even though the
                    intimacy of the camp has never been apart of my background, the intimacy of living next to it was,
                    inCody, Wyoming. One of the largest camps was Heart Mountain relocationcenter. I was a young man, a
                    boy scout, and went out tovisit the boy scout troop with the camp and behind wire were boyscouts,
                    which was rather puzzling to me, who were American citizens,who wore the same scout uniform, had the
                    same meritbadges, told the same stories, rich tapestry of stories.That is where I met Norm Mineta
                    first. He was behind the wirethere at Heart Mountain. That was a different time, and that wasdone by
                    a man who spent a lifetime atoning for it. Earl Warren.He signed the order. He was attorney general
                    of California. Andthen the Warren Court became the most progressive in the land.I cannot help but
                    think that that was a goad to him in his yearson the bench. Anyway, it happened, and the Supreme
                    Court of theUnited States embraced it, and I believe you referred to it as one ofthe most shocking—I
                    cannot recall—anyway, you said that was anextraordinary decision, appalling decision. But
                    nevertheless, it wasa decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, and that I think is indicativeof the fact
                    that we were at war, and things were happening off ourcoast. We were told that there were submarines
                    out there sendingsignals to people on shore who were going to do things to us inAmerica.You see, all
                    of that escapes us in this process. The full scope of itis not there. And yet, as I say, I am a
                    co-sponsor of that bill. Wehave things to do, and we will do them. But it is a sensitive issue.It
                    was a sensitive issue in my hometown, because, you know, on thedoor it would say, "My son has been
                    killed." And then other peoplewould say "we want to open our hearts to these American citizens."It
                    was a very confusing thing for this kid, at the age of thirteen.But the civil rights legislation.
                    You know, your writings on thecivil rights legislation were not one whit different than some of
                    BillFulbright's, Sam Ervin's, John Sparkman—vice presidential candidateof the United States of
                    America on the Democratic ticket—saying the same things you were. The same about, you know, thisis
                    puzzling, you own a private establishment, are you not able tojudge who you will allow in it? We are
                    not talking about race.Everybodysays "ah, you are, don't give us that."So it was interesting, to me,
                    to go back and look at the record ofthe voting, and especially an amendment from a man that all of
                    usin the Senate refer to as Mr. Constitution. Sam Ervin. A marvelousman. It was my pleasure to know
                    him during his lifetime, and toshare a few rich stories with him. That was a delight.He had an
                    amendment to the civil rights legislation which providedthat nothing in the title should be
                    construed as requiring anyperson to render any personal service to another against his will.Pretty
                    heavy stuff. Twenty-one people voted for that in the U.S.Senate. Some are here.Sam Ervin had another
                    one about covered establishments. Hegot 19 votes on that one. Sparkman had an amendment to
                    exemptfrom coverage eating establishments located within the residenceof the owner or proprietor.
                    That was the vice presidential candidateof the United States, I am speaking of. Twenty-five voted
                    forthat one.That is called reality, I think. And not one of these people whowere involved, and who
                    sit with us presently in our midst, are anylesser people for anything they did on this.So what is
                    the test on you, that makes this so impossible as anargument, when here we have men who voted on
                    that issue? Allyou did was write on it, and a lot of people wrote on it. Democrats,Republicans,
                    conservatives and liberals wrote on it in 1963. Nobodywould be writing on it today, but we are not
                    talking about today.That is just the way it is.Then, of course, I went back and looked at what you
                    have talkedabout the Bakke case, and you get flack of all kinds on that. I haveheard that rattling
                    off the walls here, about what you did on affirmativeaction, and it is an extraordinary attack on
                    you thatseems continual in its drum fire about civil rights. You handledthat beautifully.I do not
                    know what more you can do. I mean, while they havebeen talking, you have been voting with your
                    decisions.I was interested in the quote from the Congressional Record in1964 of the Senate debate.
                    This quote.Contrary to the allegations of some opponents of this title, there is nothing in itthat
                    would give any power to the commission, or to any other court to requirehiring, firing, or promotion
                    of employees in order to meet a racial quota, or toachieve a certain racial balance.Title VTI is
                    designed to encourage hiring on the basis of ability, and qualifications,not race nor religion. That
                    bugaboo has been brought up a dozen times. It is nonexistent.That was Hubert Humphrey that said
                    that. Hubert Humphreysaid that about that bill. And then he said, too, is simply what thebill
                    does—as was pointed out so earlier today—is simply to make itillegal, an illegal practice to use
                    race as a factor of denying employment.It provides that men and women shall be employed "on the
                    basisof their qualifications, not as Catholic citizens, not as Protestantcitizens, not as Jewish
                    citizens, not as colored citizens"—the use ofthat term offensive in itself these days—"but only as
                    citizens of theUnited States."Then—and I am quoting again from Hubert Humphrey—nothing in the bill
                    or in the amendments requires racial quotas. The bill does notprovide that people shall be hired on
                    the basis of being Polish or Scandinavian, orGerman, or Negro—another phrase that is not used in the
                    vernacular of our day—or members of a particular religious faith.It provides that employers shall
                    seek and recruit employees on the basis of theirtalents, their merit, and their qualifications for
                    the job. The employer, not the Government,will establish the standards.Those are quotations of
                    Hubert Humphrey in the 1964 debate ofthe Civil Rights law. So I think, you know, really, I do not
                    think wereally have to muck around in that much more.I am sure you have thought a lot about the
                    Indiana Law Journalarticle. It comes to you in the night, doesn't it? I do not think anybodyhas ever
                    quoted from the first two paragraphs of it, and Ithink that is disturbing. Because what you said
                    there, in this article,in the Indiana Law journal—it said:A persistently disturbing aspect of
                    constitutional law is its lack of theory, a lackwhich is manifest not only in the work of the courts
                    but in the public.And then you go on to say—and I never heard anybody bringthis up. "The remarks
                    that follow do not, of course, offer a generaltheory of constitutional law. They are more properly
                    viewed asranging shots"—you have had a few ranging shots back on the article,and I am sure that is
                    probably why you wrote it, after gettingto know you."They are more properly viewed as ranging shots,
                    an attempt toestablish the necessity for theory, and to take the argument of howconstitutional
                    doctrine should be evolved by courts a step or twofurther." That is what you said.Nobody has brought
                    that up. And then you said—and this is allon the first page. I have heard page 18 quoted, page 22
                    quoted,page 30, but I have never heard anything on the first and lastpage, which it seems to me that
                    most people would get the flavor ofa literary piece, or a law review article.And you went on to say,
                    quote:The style is informal since these remarks were originally lectures, and I have notthought it
                    worthwhile to convert these speculations and arguments into a heavilyresearched, balanced, and
                    thorough presentation, for that would result in a book.Unquote.And then it goes on to say that the
                    article was delivered in thespring of 1971 by Professor Bork as part of the Addison C. Harrislecture
                    series at the University of Indiana School of Law.At the end of the article you made another
                    statement. One sentence."These remarks are intended to be tentative and exp-loratory."Now, I do not
                    think we can work the rubric of the ages aroundthat kind of thing. It is a good provocative piece.
                    You found thatout.Did you ever stop to think—at least it came to me—that youknow what could be
                    really chilling in this country, especially forcandidates for the judiciary, or young lawyers, or
                    judges, or lawreview editors flapping their wings? You know what could really bechilling? If people
                    dug our articles like this 20 or 30 years after youhad done them, or ten, and said, "Look at this."
                    That is what theyare doing with it, nothing more.I cannot imagine anything more chilling on the flow
                    of freethought and theorizing, and ideas, than to pick up an article whichis just that, and
                    described as that, and hang it around your necklike a layaliere for the rest of your life.That is
                    really bizarre, in my mind. So, as we talk about "chilling"—I love that phrase—it depends on where
                    it hurts, and everythingis chilling—chilling this and chilling that. Well, that is apretty good
                    chiller, right there, on some young man who is going tobe asked to do a law review article and make
                    it provocative.That is what happened to Pat Wald. She was asked to do a provocativearticle on the
                    rights of a child and the family relationship,a child of 12 or 13, and it was a remarkable piece.
                    Well, I tell you:that remarkable lady took the slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneon that
                    one.And so I just wanted to comment on some of those things. Thosethings means something to me
                    because they are topical. You couldtalk about the right to privacy, and then for me to learn that
                    itwas a law professor's exercise on that contraception case in Connecticut;nothing had ever been
                    brought about it, and then they finallynailed the doctor who was selling such devices, and it went
                    tothe Supreme Court. It did not look like that to me when I waspracticing law in Cody, Wyoming. I
                    thought it was pretty heavystuff. But now I see it was kind of a pedantic exercise, kind ofsomething
                    to stretch the wings of professors, or something. Andoften, I have found in my life that professors
                    sometimes blur theline between divinity and tenure. And that is one of the chargesagainst you.How do
                    you feel about that one? You know, they think JudgeBork is arrogant. That has been said. How do you
                    respond to that?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, certainly, anyone who has listened to youin these last 2 days has no
                    fault with your mind or your articulateability and your intelligence. That is extraordinary, and
                    that isvery obvious.But again, those are interesting things as we get into all the stuffof cases and
                    case law and who did this to what, and what themeaning was of the non-unanimous decision written in
                    1981 or1982; it is just kind of unique. And then the right to privacy—and Ido not know much more to
                    develop on that. I think, hopefully, thathas been developed.As to that case and what you said, I was
                    just interested—youtalk about the right to privacy in topical terms—I was startled at avery small
                    clipping, which I have never heard anybody commenton yet, and I throw it out and will move on to my
                    questions.It was in a kind of a gossip column of one of the local papers inJuly, during the time of
                    the Oliver North hearing. It was writtenin a flippant style, and it said something about Oliver
                    North, afterlong days before the Iran-Contra Committee, can apparently comehome now to tapes of this
                    performance. Get this, "No one knowsfor sure if he is taping all those hours for posterity, but he
                    did buya VCR last New Years Eve, from Erol's, in Sterling Park, Virginia,and just 3 weeks ago had a
                    repair technician in to see that the machinewas in proper working order." "Interestingly"—I am
                    quoting—"Erol's has no record in its computers that North or his wifeis a member of the video rental
                    club, or that he has ever rented amovie there. And to think of all those John Wayne movies he
                    couldbe watching."You know, that is funny—but that ain't funny at all.We talk about the right to
                    privacy. Well, I do not know howmany in this room would like to have the newspaper go and
                    checkthrough Erol's or Freddy's Video, and find out what they arechecking out down there when you go
                    to get the tape, and you tellthem you got one on bird-watching, and it is about a
                    red-headed,double-breasted mattress-thrasher. [Laughter.]So, if we really are talking about privacy
                    in September of 1987,we ought to be paying a lot more attention to that little item in thenewspaper
                    than anything in the case of Griswold. That is myhumble and earnestly-held opinion.God, I have been
                    waiting a long time to drop that one. Butreally, that is very perplexing. I do not know how it is
                    for the restof my fellow lawyers, but it is so for this lawyer. That is one of themost offensive
                    things I can imagine, to know that a reporter canget to go down and go through your videotape rental
                    records, whereveryou are in the United States, and not pretend that is not amost offensive kind of
                    conduct.And I have often said if there had been four FBI agents hangingout in that house, watching
                    Gary Hart, we would be reading aboutit yet. But they were not; they were members of the fourth
                    estate.So you know, there is an arrogance all around here, I think. Andthen, just to be terribly
                    topical, this morning, I see that the gentleman who said that you were an agnostic—where is that
                    lovelylittle thing—he said</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I argued as Solicitor General—I argued, made anoral argument, and filed
                    briefs as amicus for the United States, inthe case that brought the death penalty back after Furman
                    v. Georgia.And what you find in the Constitution is not only no prohibitionof the death penalty, but
                    you find repeated statements in theConstitution that the framers assumed the availability of the
                    deathpenalty.For example, the fifth amendment—"No person shall be held toanswer for a capital crime,
                    unless on presentment for indictment ofa grand jury." Well, a capital crime is the death
                    penalty."Nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twiceput in jeopardy of life or
                    limb." If you are put in jeopardy of life,that is the death penalty."Nor shall any person be
                    deprived of life, liberty, or propertywithout due process of law." Well, being deprived of life is
                    thedeath penalty. So the framers tell you that you have to have dueprocess of law, but you can
                    impose the death penalty.The 14th amendment in 1868: "No State shall deprive any personof life,
                    liberty, or property without due process of law." That is thedeath penalty again.I think there is
                    one more reference in the Constitution to thedeath penalty, Senator, but there are four, right
                    there, that assumethe availability of the death penalty so far as the Constitution isconcerned.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Let me ask you another question. It was so interestingto me, especially in
                    the advertising that swirls aroundAmerica—and I have not found anybody yet who wants to take
                    responsibilityfor it; I have talked to some groups who I thought weredoing it, and they said, "Oh,
                    we are not responsible for that"—so Ihave not found anybody yet, because it is offensive, and they
                    haveall figured that out. But it is interesting how they stick the word"poll tax" out there as if it
                    were, quote, "racisim"—because that isall they have done. And "poll tax" to the layman out there
                    isracist.But I think it is important to know that that is not what thatcase had anything to do with
                    at all; isn't that correct?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Let me ask you—I listened this morning asSenator Metzenbaum reviewed
                    antitrust, and that was a law schoolseminar for me, because Senator Metzenbaum is our pro on
                    antitruston this panel, and I know that with your book, the book youwrote on the antitrust paradox,
                    is really probably one of the mostrespected volumes in that field. And I would like to—in fact,
                    mygood friend from Ohio, as I say, who I always take to conferencecommittees with me, at least when
                    I was in the majority—I hopehe will take me with him on a few now that I am in the minority—he said,
                    "I am familiar with your views with respect to antitrustlegislation, antitrust enforcement, and you
                    and I are totally in disagreementon that subject." And that is Howard Metzenbaum; helets you know
                    where he is coming from.Then he said, "However, as I said at the time Justice O'Connorwas up for
                    confirmation"—this was on her—"the fact that myviews might differ from hers on any one of a number
                    of differentissues would not in any way affect my judgment as pertains to confirmationor failure to
                    confirm a member of the Judiciary." Othershave made those statements, and I think that they are
                    important,and they are known.But I think that I want to enter into the record, Mr. Chairman, aletter
                    from the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling of New York</p>

                    the firm. He is a past chairmanof the section of antitrust law, and he is commenting upon an
                    articleby Colman McCarthy, which was rather strident, on July 12thof 1987, stating that your views
                    on antitrust law were, quote, "overthe edge," unquote, and anti-consumer.He writes on his behalf and
                    on behalf of all of the previous chairmenof the section—and I think there were 15—who take issuewith
                    that and state that your book is among the most importantworks written in this field in the past 25
                    years; referred to by theU.S. Supreme Court and by the U.S. Court of Appeals in 75 decisionssince
                    its publication; six of the nine present Justices havecited Judge Bork's work, and that all of them
                    have joined opinionsciting it.I think that is what we want to get into the record from peoplewho are
                    totally knowledgeable in the field, and they say that Mr.McCarthy is also quite wrong in his
                    suggestion that your leaning,writings, are anti-consumer.So I would like that entered into the
                    record, and I think that is avery important thing for people to know—the full statement.</p>

                    gender and as it relates to racial discrimination, and itwas helpful. I must say that after
                    yesterday I was very concerned. Istill have a couple of points, if I could get to them, and you
                    maywant to clarify anything that you said yesterday.First, let me just clarify this, Judge. You have
                    stated that younow believe that the fourteenth amendment, the equal protectionclause, applies to
                    women. There is no question about that, is there,anymore?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NOW, what about some of the post-Reedcases like the Craig v. Boren case
                    where you stated, quote,when the Supreme Court decided that having different drinking ages for young
                    menand young women violated the equal protection clause, I thought that was trivializingthe
                    Constitution and to spread it to areas it did not address.Now, taking that case, I have a problem,
                    Judge. Where are you?Justice Powell, Stewart and Stevens, who you've cited here quite abit, stated
                    and Justice Powell stated in his concurring opinion,This gender-based classification does not bear a
                    fair and substantial relation tothe object of the legislation.Now, I am trying to find out where you
                    draw the line in yourreasonable test, and I have not found that out, and if you couldhelp me in a
                    few words, it would be helpful. Let me go ahead andgive you two more cases and then you can answer
                    all three of themand maybe I can understand it.Let me give you a couple of cases using what I
                    consider the strictor the higher level of scrutiny struck down. The statutes in questionwhich I am
                    going to give you here are which, under the basisof violating equal protection clause. Yet the
                    dissent in these casessaid the rational basis test should have been used and the statuteshould have
                    been upheld. One is the Frontiero v. Richardson case,if you are familiar with that case, a 1973
                    case. Under the statute aserviceman could claim his wife as a dependent for the purpose ofobtaining
                    increased living allowance, medical and dental benefitswithout regard to whether she was, in fact,
                    dependent upon him orany part of her support was dependent upon him. But a servicewoman may not
                    claim a husband as a dependent for such purposesunless he could prove that half of his support was
                    dependent onher. Now, that case was decided 8 to 1 with Rehnquist writing thedissent.Now, another
                    case very near to that is Kaban v. Muhammed1979. Under that statute, a mother but not the father of
                    an illegimatechild could block the adoption of a child by withholding theconsent. Now, that was a 4
                    to 5 decision with Justice Powell writingthat.Now, comparing these two cases and comparing that
                    rational testthat was applied to both of these cases, I understand these casesthat the dissent used
                    that rational, quote, "reasonable" test whichyou said is that you used, as I understand it correctly
                    and is yourview of the rational basis test different from the dissenters in thesetwo cases or is
                    that what it is, and if it is, I understand it. Itdoesn't throw you out of the Supreme Court as far
                    as I'm concerned.What I want to know is where you are.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">But maybe it is semantics.Okay, let me go to something else, Judge. And that
                    is helpful.Let me say, also, I appreciate the time you have spent with thiscommittee and the
                    forthrightness that you have displayed over thelast few days. As we talked before you came here for
                    the actualconfirmation hearing, you have been forthcoming and it has madea great deal of difference
                    to me because of the circumstances surroundingyour nomination. Not you personally, just because of
                    thecircumstances of why we are here.I am very concerned, Judge Bork, about the activism, charges
                    ofand my belief of overactivism on the Court today, and then I scrutinizea number of judges who have
                    sat on the Court who are in theconservative column, and they seem to have some activism, too.And you
                    certainly have been very critical of the Supreme Court,and some of the opinions you have written and
                    gone into, I want toreview one because I want you to explain what activism is to youand does it
                    apply to you when you expound on a case.I want to turn your attention to Finzer v. Barry. I want to
                    acknowledgethat the Supreme Court has granted certiorari in thecase, and that it would be improper
                    for you to comment on anyaspect of the issues presented by that case, so I am not going to tryto do
                    that.The question that I do have is how do you go about in determiningthe framers' intent, and is
                    that activism as you explain that?And let me read you some of the opinion.In that opinion you
                    state:The framers understood that the protection to foreign embassies from insult wasone of the
                    central obligations of the law of nations. It is also clear that the Founderswho explicitly gave
                    Congress the power to enforce adherence to the standards of thelaw of nations, which they understood
                    well, saw no incompatibility between the nationalinterest and any guaranteed individual freedom.I
                    find this to be an interesting quote. It almost is—well, let mesay this. When a decision, in your
                    opinion, calls for an analysis ofthe framers' intent, I want to know how you come to that in lieu
                    ofthis case.In this particular decision you did a thorough and long overviewof threats to embassies
                    and how governments attempted to protectthem. You cited "Blackstone's Commentaries," a letter
                    written byMillard Fillmore in 1851, an article written on the law of the nationsin 1863, an incident
                    in Philadelphia in 1902 in which a foreignflag was burned and no one was prosecuted, a U.S.
                    AttorneyGeneral's opinion in 1794 that says the law of libel is strengthenedin the case of foreign
                    ministers because the law of nations securesa minister from insult, and a 1779 resolution by the
                    ContinentalCongress urging that the right of ambassadors be protected.This process seems to me a
                    very laborious process that you wentthrough, and I enjoyed reading it, I must say, for the history
                    involvedin it—for you to go through to arrive at your decision that"it is also clear that the
                    founders who explicitly gave Congress thepower to enforce adherence to the standards of the law of
                    nations,which they understood well, saw no incompatibility between thisnational interest and any
                    guaranteed individual freedom."How would you respond to the statement, when you are a nonactivistand
                    a strict interpretationist, if you want to call it that, orbelieve in the original intent that we
                    have discussed here for 2 or 3days—how do you rationalize this long historical basis for your
                    decisionsthat seem to go far away from the original intent?</p>

                    As you and I know, but not all our listenersmay, "result orientation" is a term of art that we
                    judges use describingsome judges methods for judging a case, in which a judgewould pay more
                    attention to results than legitimate reasoning.The people in this case who brought the lawsuit and
                    whom Iruled against were conservatives who wanted to go out and speakand pray, and congregate in
                    front of the Soviet and the Nicaraguanembassies. So when I ruled against them, it was not exactly
                    anaction of a conservative activist. And what I did—by the way</p>

                    prevents people from carrying placards,as I recall, offensive to a foreign embassy within 500 feet,
                    or congregatingthere. And it has therefore both aspects. One is theaspect of protecting the security
                    of the embassy, and we had affidavitsabout the difficulty—if we allow people right up close to
                    theembassy, it becomes almost impossible for the police to protect thesecurity of the embassy—and
                    the aspect of insult to the ambassadorand his staff. And that is what Congress had in mind.Those are
                    deeply-rooted in our constitutional tradition. The framerswere worried about insult to ambassadors.
                    The ContinentalCongress, as you pointed out, was worried about it. In fact, onereason—not a major
                    reason, but one reason—I think, for a ConstitutionalConvention was that before the Constitution they
                    had torely upon the States to protect ambassadors, and not all the Stateswould do so, and our
                    foreign relations were in kind of a tangle anda mess.And therefore in article I, section 8, clause
                    10, Congress is explicitlygiven the power to define and punish offenses against the lawof nations.
                    And offenses to ambassadors or dangers to the securityof ambassadors is, of course</p>

                    recess, Judge, and then SenatorGrassley, I think, will be up.Let me go into one more quick area,
                    judicial restraint. It hasbeen stated by some of your supporters that your personal views donot
                    enter into your judicial analysis of the case. In describing theunwelcome heterosexual harassment of
                    a subordinate by a supervisorin Vinson v. Taylor, you use casual, sometimes what I wouldterm
                    flippant, words. However, in describing the consequences of aconsentual homosexual relationship in
                    the Dronenberg case, youstated—and I want to read it real quickly—Episodes of this sort are certain
                    to deleterious to morale and discipline, to callinto question the even-handedness of superiors
                    dealing with lower ranks, to makepersonal dealings uncomfortable where the relationship is sexually
                    ambiguous, togenerate dislike and disapproval among many who find homosexuality morally
                    offensive,and it must be said, given the powers of military supervisors over their inferiors,to
                    enhance the possibility of homosexual seduction.Then you go on in that opinion—which I am sure you
                    are familiarwith; you did not write it that long ago, and I read it with someinterest—you go on at
                    great length, I think it is about nine pages,explaining this.In this kind of a case, what brought
                    you to expand and put inwhat appears to be your philosophy? Is that judicial activism?What do you
                    call it?</p>

                <strong>Chuck Grassley</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">I want to once again welcome you back beforethe committee. I know it is a
                    lot of hard work.Before I start some questioning, I want to say something that Ithink needs to be
                    said. This has been touched on before, but I thinkit bears repeating. For about 12 hours now, you
                    have responded tosome of the most intense questioning. You have been under a greatdeal of scrutiny,
                    and I think that you have done very well indeed.But the point I want to make is that I do not think
                    in the historyof the Senate has a nominee been subject to this kind of questioning;and, never has a
                    judicial nominee like you been so forthcomingin his views. And I hope that I am right when I say
                    that it is myrecollection of history that it was not until 1955 that this committeeeven made it a
                    practice of questioning Supreme Court nomineeson their views.So by my count, that would mean that we
                    probably, in the historyof our country up to that point, had 90 Supreme Court Justicesserve without
                    such questioning, and many of those 90 served withdistinction. They were approved and then took
                    their place on theCourt without going through any of the formal questioning processthat you are
                    going through.So I think some perspective is in order. It is to your credit; yourfull knowledge of
                    the law; what people watching on televisionought to see as a powerful intellect. And I do not know
                    how anybodycan recall such long ago happenings and writings and eventsas you do. You have been able
                    to recall quite a bit. I think youneed to be complimented for that.I believe that you have
                    responded, it seems to me, with candorand more patience than any Senator would ever have, and
                    obviouslymore grace than any Senator would have. So thank you verymuch.These inquiries that we have
                    been questioning you about now forthese last 12 hours have covered the full scope of your lifetime
                    inthe Jaw. This involves more than 100 legal opinions that you havewritten while you have been on
                    the D.C. Circuit, dozens of lawschool review articles that you have written, countless speechesthat
                    you have made, and your Solicitor General briefs. I could goon and on about what you have drawn on
                    to answer these questions.Today, we have branched out into some quotes from a 462-pagebook on
                    antitrust law that you wrote, I believe, back in 1978. Andmake no mistake about it, most of these
                    questions have been tough;many have been fair. I do not know whether you have former studentsof
                    yours watching, who would have taken some first-year lawschool classes from you; however, they may
                    take some personalpleasure in seeing a former professor on the receiving end of theSocratic
                    method.Two days ago, some people announced that you are a rigid ideologue,with a closed mind on a
                    whole host of legal issues. Just yesterday,some of these same people said that you change your
                    mind•too much or that, even worse, you have styled your responses toadvance your legal career.Of
                    course, I guess maybe lawyers—and I am not a lawyer, as yourecall—may call this "arguing the
                    alternative." In politics, we callit "having it both ways".What really needs to be said is almost
                    self-evident—that there isno one in this room, particularly those of us in this body, whocould
                    withstand the kind of scrutiny that you have, and I just wantto take a few minutes out of my
                    half-hour to commend you forthat.Judge Bork, I do not expect you to recall where I left off
                    yesterday,but that is where I want to take up. You and I were in theprocess of discussing how it is
                    that the Bill of Rights can evolve. Asa follow-up of the evolution of rights, does the fact that the
                    applicationof the fourth amendment in the 20th century, covering illegalelectronic surveillance, or
                    that the first amendment covers theelectronic media, tell us that your philosophy allows the Bill
                    ofRights to evolve?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I think, Senator, one way of putting that is that youlook at the founders
                    and the ratifiers, and you look at the text ofthe Constitution, their words, what it was that was
                    troubling themat the time, why they did this, and you look at the FederalistPapers and the
                    Anti-Federalist Papers and so forth and so on andso on, to get what the public understanding of the
                    time was ofwhat the evil was they wished to avert, what the freedom was theywished to protect. And
                    once you have that, that is your majorpremise; and then the judge has to supply the minor premise
                    tomake sure to ask whether that value, that freedom, is being threatenedby some new development in
                    the law or in society or in technologytoday. And then he makes the old freedom effective today
                    inthese new circumstances.That is going to mean changing legal doctrine, evolving legal doctrine,in
                    order to protect the original value or freedom that theframers and ratifiers of the Constitution
                    wanted to protect.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Oh, that is absolutely preposterous. Nobody is goingto pass, in the first
                    place—this Congress is not going to pass a statutesegregating the schools in the District of
                    Columbia. If this Congress,in a fit of forgetfulness did, Boiling v. Sharpe is precedentthere is
                    absolutely no reason to overrule; none.You know, all kinds of expectations and institutions have
                    grownup around it. And this morning, I also mentioned that one mighthave supported Boiling v. Sharpe
                    on a first amendment rationale,and perhaps I did not explain that too clearly.The first amendment
                    protections include associational rights aswell as other rights. And a law forbidding associations
                    on groundsof race might—I do not say would; I am not adopting a legaltheory; I am just saying we are
                    into an area of arguability here—might be attached on associational right grounds under the
                    firstamendment.But to say that the reasoning of any case seems not adequate isnot to say you want to
                    overrule it, and it is certainly not to say youwant to bring back the underlying statute. Neither of
                    those is truein my case.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">My views of this doctrine are almost identical withthose of the Supreme
                    Court. It is a separation of powers doctrine,and it is a doctrine that is essential to keep the
                    courts from dominatingthe society. As Lewis Powell has said, standing is about theproper and
                    properly limited role of courts in a democratic society.And that is this reason. And this, oddly
                    enough, I got from aspeech—it is in a footnote somewhere, if I cannot find it now—I gotfrom a speech
                    given by Chief Justice John Marshall in Congress.He said courts are there to decide controversies
                    when an individualor an organization has been hurt. And it has to be the individualwho has standing
                    and not the issue involved which gives standing.Otherwise, courts could just take on any issue they
                    wanted to andpractically run the government.Standing is a way of making sure that people are really
                    hurt,suffered some injury, before they come in to litigate some largeconstitutional question or
                    statutory question that they would justlike to litigate out of interest.Now, there are two aspects
                    of standing. One is the article III coreof standing. That is, the Court has said that part of
                    standing beinga separation of powers question is demanded by the Constitution.But there is an
                    additional aspect of standing which is not demandedby the Constitution, but the courts have required
                    as a prudentialmatter. Congress is free to give standing in the area wherecourts would deny it on
                    prudential grounds, but not free to givestanding where the court thinks that article III denies
                    standing.Now, I should say that my opinions on standing, as I have ananalysis of them here by a
                    professor you might all know—he pointsout that my views on standing are almost identical to Lewis
                    Powell's.And indeed, I was following some Lewis Powell opinions. Andwhen I wrote a standing opinion,
                    Justice O'Connor quoted my opinionin her next opinion, so that</p>

                    analysis is entirely the same.Let me say in this opinion I wrote, Barnes v. Kline, I said I
                    reasonedfrom Justice Powell's opinion in Wirth v. Seldin, and Iquoted him. He said,In essence, the
                    question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have thecourt decide the merits of the
                    dispute or of particular issues. This inquiry involvesboth constitutional limitations on federal
                    court jurisdiction and prudential limitationson its exercise. In both dimensions, standing is
                    founded in concern about theproper and properly limited role of the courts in a democratic
                    society.Then I wrote, right below that,This should make it clear that the jurisdictional requirement
                    of standing keepscourts out of areas that are not properly theirs. It is thus an aspect of
                    democratictheory.And that is what it does. It is one way of confining courts to theproper area of
                    their authority.</p>

                    put into the record at this time—and would ask that a committee clerk be asked to hand these outto
                    the members of the media—100 selected law professors favoringthe confirmation of Robert H. Bork as
                    Associate Justice of the U.S.Supreme Court. And let me just draw attention to a few of them:Dean
                    Robert Mundheim, of the University of Pennsylvania LawSchool, General Counsel at the Treasury
                    Department under PresidentCarter; Mary Ann Glendon, Harvard Law Professor, ChiefEditor of the
                    International Law Encyclopedia; Bruce Hafen, theDean of the Brigham Young University School of Law;
                    AlbertBlaustein, of Rutgers, President of the Human Rights AdvocatesInternational; Henry Manne,
                    Dean, George Mason Law School;Paul Marcus, Dean of the University of Arizona Law School;Steven
                    Frankino, Dean of the Villanova Law School—just to mentiona few.I think that these are eminent
                    professors, eminent names, whosupport your nomination and want to see you on the SupremeCourt, even
                    though some of them may differ with you on individualissues, as would be expected.So if I could have
                    this distributed, I would appreciate it.</p>

                    was questioningyou about the Finzer v. Barry case, and I would like to follow up onthat. My reason
                    for following up on that is because I sponsored legislationon that subject last year, along with

                    500 feet of a foreign embassy. I opposed this law becauseI think it is overly broad, and it
                    infringes upon some of ourbasic civil rights, the first amendment freedoms of speech and
                    assembly.And even worse, Judge, I think it has been a law that hasbeen selectively enforced.</p>

                    been promised by the District ofColumbia Government that it will consider changing the 500-footrule.
                    I hope they will come around to favoring the free speech pointof view.Now, last year, you authored
                    this opinion which upheld the constitutionalityof the ordinance as challenged by a group of
                    protestorswho were arrested in front of the Soviet and Nicaraguan Embassies.I am not going to ask
                    you to go into the rationale of upholding it,because I think that would be repetitive. But I think I
                    need to sayto you that I disagree with you in this case. I think the statute isover-broad. For
                    example—and this is what I really resent as far asthe District law is concerned—in 1972, Congress
                    passed a statutethat prohibits demonstrations within 100 feet of an embassy. Thisstatute also covers
                    consulates in cities in the United States, andeven the United Nations' complex. The 100-foot rule,
                    then, workswithout any danger—or, let me put it this way—I feel it protectsforeign officials
                    adequately.I am prepared to wait for a decision of the D.C. City Council asthey revisit this issue.
                    However, but I would like to assume, if Icould, that you would have no problem upholding a local
                    statutethat was more in line with the Federal law in this area.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, this morning you cited the SupremeCourt's Chadha case, which
                    struck down a version of thelegislative veto. My interest in the legislative veto has been
                    longtermin the 12 years I have been in Congress—making greater useof it, preserving it. I do not
                    like the Chadha case. I have to livewith it. Senator Levin and others and I have ways we feel that
                    wecan make the legislative veto constitutional.We feel that the legislative veto is vital to
                    Congress' ability toput the brakes on a runaway and faceless bureaucracy. And sometimes,as you deal
                    with in the courts, you know that bureaucracycan run over the rights of people.I am not looking for
                    an advisory opinion now, Judge. But what ifCongress would enact a legislative veto that provides (1)
                    bicameralpassage and (2) presentment to the President? Isn't that about allthat Chadha would require
                    for a legislative veto to be constitutional?</p>

                    be followed by the agency, the easier it isfor a court to review the agency and keep the agency
                    withinbounds. But if the delegation is unstructured and sort of open, acourt has a very difficult
                    time reviewing it, and only Congress canprovide a cure.</p>

                    with Senator Grassleyand Senator DeConcini, and a number of your supporters havestated that in 400
                    cases you have not been reversed, and have leftthe implication you have had 400 cases go up on
                    appeal. You havenot done that, sir, but a number of your supporters have. Just sowe can note for the
                    record, the Finzer case is the only majorityopinion that you have written that has gone up on appeal
                    to theSupreme Court, is that correct?</p>

                    that be, we'll go up on appeal, andwe'll see how the eight members decide it.Let me talk about
                    another area, though. We are both lawyers,and I consider that an honorable profession. I know you
                    do. Theproud tradition of pro bono work—certainly that was the thingstressed to me in the first law
                    firm I went to after I left Georgetownand went back home. That tradition wasn't always observed,but
                    it should be, because it's more than a tradition—it s an obligation.The Judiciary Committee asks
                    every single nominee for anyfederal court position, from the U.S. Claims Court to the SupremeCourt,
                    how they have fulfilled that obligation.Let me read the question we asked you, and your answer.
                    Thequestion says: "An ethical consideration under Canon 2 of theAmerican Bar Association's Code of
                    Professional Responsibilitycalls for every lawyer, regardless of professional prominence or
                    professionalworkload, to find some time to participate in serving thedisadvantaged. Describe what
                    you, Judge Bork, have done to fulfillthese responsibilities, listing specific instances, the amount
                    of timedevoted to each."And you responded: "During my time in practice, 1954-1962 . . ."—in other
                    words, 8 years—"the firms I worked for didnot engage in pro bono activities. While I was a professor
                    at Yale Iwas not a member of the Connecticut Bar and cases of this sortwere handled by teachers and
                    students in the clinical legal educationprogram."What we asked you was what you have done to make
                    legal servicesavailable to the disadvantaged. I read that answer as sayingthat you found ways why
                    you didn't fulfill the obligation. Now, in1955-1962, you were an associate, then a partner at
                    Kirkland andEllis—that's one of the finest law firms in this country. You saythe firm did not engage
                    in pro bono activities.I find that hard to believe. I can't believe in that whole firmpeople didn't
                    engage in pro bono activities.</p>

                    discussed your past writings andyour current views on issues of free speech, and you were
                    sharplycritical—as a number of us have pointed out, and you have—of awide range of doctrines which
                    the Supreme Court has employed toprotect the rights of Americans to say what they want to say.
                    Now,yesterday, though, in answer to my questions, you described yourcurrent views as much closer to
                    the idea of free speech that the SupremeCourt has applied over the past 30 or 40 years.</p>

                    variety of areas, had the legal theories I espoused,had the law developed along those lines—I'm not
                    talkingabout the political speech doctrine or idea now—I could have acceptedit. For example, I
                    talked about Brandenburg v. Ohio, andwhat I said—and we are talking there about the advocacy of
                    lawviolation. Now, I want to take out of this discussion the MartinLuther King kind of problem where
                    often Mr. King was advocatingviolating a law in order to test its constitutionality—I have noproblem
                    with that. I am talking about the advocacy of law violationwhich is not aimed at framing a
                    constitutional test. The differencebetween what I said and what Brandenburg said is this:
                    Brandenburgrequires a closer nexus, a closer connection, between theadvocacy and the lawless action
                    than I did. For example, I thought,for a variety of reasons, that one might constitutionally punish
                    advocacyof law violation, even if the violation wasn't imminent.Brandenburg added to that only the
                    qualification that the law violationmust be imminent when the speaker speaks.Now, I could have
                    accepted the law if it had developed in theway I suggested, but I can also Brandenburg in the way
                    the law diddevelop.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">And I want to go back again to some of yourstatements, because I want to
                    find out just where the changes takeplace and what it is that jogged those kinds of changes. I had
                    askedyou how far you had gone from the bright-line distinction betweenpolitical and non-political
                    speech by 1973, when you testified on thesubject before the committee in your confirmation hearings
                    for Solicitor General, and that is when you said you were about wherethe Supreme Court currently is.
                    But let me go over some of yourwritings and statements after 1973.In 1979, in your speech on the
                    first amendment at the Universityof Michigan, you said thatThe transmission of news and information
                    relevant to the political process shouldbe protected by the first amendment.And all of us can be
                    happy about that, and the news media here Iam sure are. But you went on to sayThere is no occasion
                    on this rationale to throw a constitutional protection aroundforms of expression that do not
                    directly feed the democratic process. It is sometimessaid that works of art are capable of
                    influencing political attitudes. But in these indirectand relatively remote relationships of the
                    political process, verbal or visualexpression does not differ at all from other human activities
                    such as sports or business,which are also capable of influencing political attitudes, but which are
                    not onthat account immune from regulation.Now, do you still believe that only those forms of
                    expression thatdirectly feed the democratic process should receive first amendmentprotection?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, the transmission of news and information relevantto the political
                    process includes a great deal of speech that isnot political obviously—and I have discussed this. It
                    includes moraldiscourse, social discourse, scientific discourse, and, as I said in oneof these
                    speeches, fiction. And I said there is no occasion on thisrationale to throw constitutional
                    protection around forms of expressionthat do not directly feed the democratic process.That's right;
                    on that rationale they don't. And I think I couldstill—if I were starting back, before any decisions
                    of the SupremeCourt, and trying to work out a theory of the first amendment, Isuppose I would have
                    worked out a theory about those kinds ofthings that affect political ideas. Now, as a friend of mine
                    remindedme a couple of weeks ago, if you read "The Tropic of Capricorn"by Henry Miller, you find a
                    lot of stuff in there that is really political—criticism of the establishment and so forth. So that
                    thosethings would be protected.Now, I don't know where I would come out if I sat down now inthe
                    absence of Supreme Court precedent and worked out a theoryof the first amendment—I don't know where
                    the line would bedrawn.But what I did say is that the Supreme Court has decided a lot ofthings which
                    I can accept and do accept as law, and have no desireto change.</p>

                    and Meiklejohn.In Garrison v. Louisiana, Justice Brennan talks about this core.For speech concerning
                    public affairs is more than self-expression. Itis the essence of self-government, and that is where
                    everybodystarts from, but that has moved out now to all forms of self-expressionthat are not
                    obscene.Now, I suppose if I went back and rethought the doctrine, whichI really haven't rethought
                    since 1971 except to give up on the 1971bright line, if I went back and rethought it, I would
                    suppose thatamong other things, it would place too great a burden upon courtsto sit down and ask

                    political question doctrine, courts will notsometimes get into what looks like a constitutional
                    issue if theythink there are not standards for them to apply that are suitablefor judicial
                    application. And I think that is right. Particularly, inthis case, applying the political process
                    core and moving out, itwould seem to me better, just in terms of freedom and in terms ofmaking the
                    tasks of the courts doable, to place obscenity off limitsand protest the rest.That does not mean
                    that philosophically a different line mightnot be drawn if you ignore other considerations. But I
                    have nodesire to impose a philosophical view which I do not now have.</p>

                    happy togive it to you—but the part that I am relying on, Mr. Moyers said,speaking to you, "Do you
                    think they were dealing primarily, atleast in their"—speaking of free speech—"at least in their
                    frame ofthings, with the speech of the republic, the speech of the politicaluniverse that we operate
                    in as citizens,"—speaking of those writingthe Constitution.You answered,Sure, but in addition to
                    that I am sure they recognized that other kinds ofspeech—speech about moral issues, speech about
                    moral values, religion and soforth—all of those things feed into the way we govern ourselves, so it
                    does not haveto be explicitly political speech to be protected.MOYERS. So novels."BORK. Scientific

                    theorist about what the courts had a right toforce upon legislatures by way of free speech. And it
                    seemed to methat the judgment of whether or not to allow speech that called forthe overthrow of the
                    government, or violence, was really a matterof prudence. That kind of speech does not feed the way
                    we governourselves very well.Therefore, I questioned whether or not—it seemed to me thatthat
                    prudential decision might well be left to the legislature. Thelaw did not develop that way. It
                    developed otherwise and an additionalsafeguard was added by the Supreme Court—that is, the
                    necessityof showing the imminence of lawless action.I am not sure that if I sat down and argued it
                    theoretically Iwould not criticize Brandenburg again. But it is a settled positionand I accept it.

                    out that it could have movedsomewhere else along the spectrum.That is always true.Clearly, as you
                    get into art and literature, particularly into forms of art, and ifyou want to call it literature
                    and art, which are pornography and things approachingit, you are dealing with something now that is
                    not in anyway and form the waywe govern ourselves and in fact may be quite deleterious. I would
                    doubt that courtsought to throw protection around that.</p>

                    It was on, can one really separatethose forms of self-expression that feed into what you call the

                    making a distinction. I said,The court and some judges do tend to assume that it is not a problem if
                    willingadults indulge a taste for pornography in a theatre whose outside advertising doesnot offend
                    the squeamish.I said:The assumption is wrong. The consequences of such private indulgence may
                    havepublic consequences far more unpleasant than industrial pollution. The attitudes,taste and moral
                    values inculcated do not stay behind in the theatre. A change inmoral environment and social
                    attitudes towards sex, marriage, duties toward childrenand the like may as surely be felt as harm as
                    the possibility of physical violence.And I was complaining that the Court has not explained whatthe
                    public feels to be harm in that way may not be counted as one.But again, I am talking about
                    pornography.</p>

                    perhaps the Senator from New Hampshirehas not had a chance to read, that in 1979, assuming
                    yourconsultant work at $175 an hour, you made approximately $197,000that year for consulting work;
                    in 1980, assuming $225 an hour,around $250,000 to $300,000 a year for consulting work; in 1981,

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, I regret that I missed a good partof the proceeding today
                    because I had a prior commitment to jointhe President and go into Philadelphia for the
                    celebration.But Ihave been briefed and I hope that I will not ask you on areaswhich have already
                    been covered otherwise.But I would like to return now to the question of first amendmentfreedom of
                    speech. You had made a comment in the latterpart of the questioning of Senator Leahy about what you
                    termedconfirmation conversion, suggesting that there may have beensome changes in your approach
                    today caused by the confirmationprocess.You had made a comment that Brandenburg was "not a
                    greatchange of mind" for you on this issue. And I raise a question withyou, Judge Bork, about the
                    candor of that representation. This is avery complex subject. You have to wade through an
                    enormousnumber of cases to really come to grips with it.You had commented, back in the Indiana Law
                    Review article, atpage 20, that "I am, of course, aware that this"—referring to theclear and present
                    danger test—departs drastically from existingcourt-made law."You also said, in the University of
                    Michigan speech, that "Hessand Brandenburg are fundamentally wrong interpretations of thefirst
                    amendment. And in the Indiana Law Review article, you goon for 15 pages spelling out the
                    differences, so that it seems to methat it is really plain on the face of this record your
                    understandingand acknowledgement that there is really an enormous differencebetween the principles
                    you article and that Justice Sanford had articulatedyears ago, and what the clear and present danger
                    teststands for and what Brandenburg stands for, isn't there?</p>

                    conversion, which I think is quite wrong andI have adhered to a number of positions that I have
                    taken previouslythat are controversial, or at least seem to be.On Brandenburg, I did not say my mind
                    had changed. I think itwould have been legitimate for the Court to follow the line I took,which was
                    that advocacy of violent overthrow of the Governmentor advocacy of lawless behavior, violation of
                    law, when you are nottrying to test the constitutionality of the law, the Court could havesaid that
                    the legislature may prohibit that speech.But what I said was, as a theorist, I doubted Brandenburg.
                    Ithink Brandenburg may have gone too—went too far, but I acceptBrandenburg as a judge and I have no
                    desire to overturn it. I amnot changing my criticism of the case. I just accept it as settledlaw.

                    intent and how firmly committed youare to accepting stare decisis, and there are some strong
                    statementswhich you have made that an originalist ought not to accept, caseswhich have been
                    established because of the complexity of theamendment process. That is a somewhat different
                    discussion, but Iam concerned about your views for two reasons.One, the next case will have a
                    shading and a nuance and I amconcerned about your philosophy and your approach. And, secondly,I am
                    concerned about your acceptance of these cases. If you sayyou accept this one, so be it. But you
                    have written and spoken, ostensiblyas an original interpretationist, of the importance of
                    originalistsnot allowing the mistakes of the past to stand.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">We will come back to that. Let me move aheadto the underpinnings of the
                    clear and present danger test, and letme read a very short extract from Holmes' dissenting opinion
                    inAbrams at page 630 of 270 United States Reports. And I think,Judge Bork, this is really the
                    essence of the first amendment freedomof speech, and this is the doctrine which you have
                    characterized as being "internally inconsistent" and being "terrifying frivolity."But when men have
                    realized that time has upset any fighting fates they maycome to believe, even more than they believe
                    the very foundations of their own conduct,that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free
                    trade in ideas, that thebest test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the
                    competitionof the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safelycan be
                    carried out. That, at any rate, is the theory of our Constitution.Now you had very strongly
                    criticized the Holmes statementwhich appears at page 20 of your Michigan Lav/ Review speech,and you
                    say this:There is doubt about even the proviso, for Holmes could bring himself to write inGitlow,
                    and Brandeis to join him, that, "If in the long run the beliefs expressed inproletarian dictatorship
                    are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of thecommunity, the only meaning of free speech
                    is that they should be given theirchance and have their way." That statement [and this is you
                    speaking now] defiesexplanation.It seems to me, Judge Bork, in studying the long line of cases
                    onfreedom of speech, that the essence of a lusty debate and full discourseis to let it go on and on
                    and on until you reach the point ofimminent violence. And if there is imminent violence, then there
                    isa clear and present danger, and it stops and it becomes wrongfulconduct, and it becomes criminal
                    conduct.But even in the context where the proponent argues the proletariandictatorship, as much as
                    we dislike it, we say, go ahead. Oreven as much as the proponent says, "Let's have a revolution
                    toget there," which is the advocacy of lawlessness which you alsocondemn, that seems to me to be
                    within the Holmes doctrine and aproper description of the law and the spirit of freedom of
                    speech.Because if the person has to resort to violence in a democratic society,it shows the
                    absurdity of his position, when he doesn't needunder our system to resort to violence.But as long as
                    it is mere words, he ought to be permitted to sayit, and that, as I read the cases and get the feel
                    of the first amendment.And freedom of speech is really the core value, and is hardlyfrivolous.</p>

                    defies explanation on his own terms. He issaying, and in this first part I agree with him entirely,
                    that thefirst amendment is intended to protect free trade in ideas, and thetest of their truth is
                    their acceptance in the marketplace of ideas.That is fine.Then he says it is all right for people to
                    advocate revolution toshut the marketplace of ideas—to advocate violence by which a minoritywill
                    seize the government and shut off the marketplace ofideas. And he concludes that by saying,If, in

                    dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of freespeech is they should be given their
                    chance and have their way.Dominant forces in the community is not a majority voting forproletarian
                    dictatorship, and the man who was speaking there wasnot advocating an election to put in proletarian
                    dictatorship. Hewas advocating violence to close the marketplace of ideas. He wasadvocating violence
                    to close, to stop the free trade in ideas.Now that it seems to me you can't get from "the most
                    wonderfulthing about our society is the free trade in ideas" to "it's all rightfor this fellow to
                    try to get people to overthrow the government sothat they can close the free trade in ideas."</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Well, one—Sanford's point, a point I think that hadsome merit to it, is that
                    if you get a lot of these arguments goingon you don't know when violence is imminent. A lot of this
                    is conspiratorialand advocacy taking place in organizations that organizelike military units.Now it
                    does seem to me, or it seemed to me then and I suppose itseems to me now, that it would be a
                    defensible first amendmentposition to say that whether or not there is a real danger to ourform of
                    government and to our freedoms and to our free speechposed by this kind of thing, advocacy of
                    violence to close the marketplaceof ideas, is a legislative judgment, and they may choose tolet that
                    speech go forward or not. That was what I said then, and itseems to me it is a tenable philosophical
                    position now.However, I have also said that, that is, the settled law hasbecome otherwise. The
                    Holmes-Brandeis position has triumphed inthe law, and Brandenburg, while it is different from the
                    clear andpresent danger test, and you can tell that because the clear andpresent danger test was
                    applied in the Dennis cases, you know, theSmith Act cases about the Communist Party, and
                    Brandenburgwould not uphold the Smith Act—the Dennis case, we have nowcome to the Brandenburg test.
                    And I think, as I have said, I don'tknow, if we were starting over again, that I wouldn't have
                    agreedwith Sanford in the first place. I mean, a majority of the SupremeCourt agreed with it.All I
                    am telling you is I now accept, as a judge, the position thatthe law has reached, and I have no
                    desire to overturn it. I have nodesire to whittle it away. But that does not mean that I have
                    abandonedmy original critique of those theories. I haven't even thoughtabout them again, much less
                    abandoned them.</p>

                    harmcaused by speech that society can protect itself against is the prospectof imminent violence.
                    After much weaving through such casesof Dennis and Yates, that reading was imposed upon the
                    firstamendment in the last year of the Warren Court in Brandenburgv. Ohio."So you flatly say there,
                    as a matter of analysis, that Brandenburgdoes pick up the Holmes-Brandeis doctrine of clear

                    Brandenburg decision. Because under that versionof clear and present danger, which is one version of
                    it that itseems to me quite possible to hold, under that version of clear andpresent danger there
                    may be no imminent act. It may be quite away down the road. But if the danger is greater enough,
                    thatdoesn't matter.Now, Brandenburg said we need a closer connection between thespeech and the
                    danger. We need a closer nexus. It has to be imminentlawlessness. So I think Brandenburg does differ
                    from at leastthe way Hand and a plurality of the Supreme Court interpretedclear and present danger.

                    very central matter. Here again, itmay be the same line of consideration.As recently as this year,
                    June 10, 1987—it's the Worldnet comment,and this is at page 12, where you talk about the equal
                    protectionclause. You say, "I do think the equal protection clause probablyshould have been kept to
                    things like race and ethnicity", andback in the Indiana Law Review you had written in stronger
                    termsthat the equal protection clause applied only to race.My first question is, if you work from
                    the framers' intent, andyou have said that the framers' intent covered only race, how doyou even
                    justify covering ethnic distinctions? How do you even justifythe Yick Wo case in 1886 involving the
                    Chinaman who had appliedfor a license to have a laundry and got turned down in SanFrancisco? Can you
                    imagine not having Chinese laundries</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I don't have the citations in front of me. Ifyou look at Congressman
                    Bingham's discussions, he, of course,talked about almost everything that it covered. But he is not
                    theonly one. He merely proposed the amendment, and he proposed—By the way, he thought it
                    incorporated the Bill of Rights againstthe States.If you go to the ratifiers, there's a great deal
                    of talk about variousthings. If one approaches the amendment by saying it appliesto groups, and you
                    have to decide which group is covered andwhich group is not covered, then I think you're going to
                    have tosay they were talking about race and perhaps, as Justice Rehnquisthas said, race-like things,
                    whatever those are.Now, there is a difficulty with that, and the difficulty is that thetext doesn't
                    read that way. But more than that, the fact is that theSupreme Court, for all of this century and
                    perhaps before, hascome up with a reasonable basis test so that they have applied theequal
                    protection clause under that test to everything, even to economicdistinctions. If you take the
                    reasonable basis test seriously,which they have not always done, when they called it a
                    rationalitystandard, if you take the reasonable basis test seriously, then theclause applies to the
                    reasonableness of all distinctions betweenpeople and it applies to things well beyond race. That is
                    settled doctrineand it's been going on for a long time now. It doesn't requireyou to say which
                    groups are in and which groups are out, which isthe way the Supreme Court was approaching it.</p>

                    the original intent of the framersand the ratifiers. The framers and ratifiers did not have women

                    it in the Indiana article, because they begin toimagine rational bases.For example, I cited the
                    cases—I cited critically in the Indianaarticle. They upheld the statute that said women couldn't be
                    bartendersunless they were related to a male owner or proprietor ofthe bar. I thought that was a
                    ridiculous distinction and I criticizedit.There are two methodologies. Let me be as clear as I can
                    aboutthis. One is to say we will pick a group and say which level of scrutinydoes it get. It is
                    often said that race distinctions get strict scrutinyand require a compelling governmental
                    interest.Then there is intermediate scrutiny. Then there is rational basis,which is not what I'm
                    talking about on an unreasonable basis.Those are almost conclusions. You know if they get strict
                    scrutiny,the statute is going to be struck down. You know if it gets rationalityscrutiny, it's going
                    to be upheld.In the intermediate case, the intermediate level of scrutiny, youdon't know what
                    they're going to do. There is no predictability toit.I prefer to apply a reasonableness basis test
                    to all of those levels,and the result of that is that distinctions based on race almostnever will be
                    reasonable, except in the most urgent circumstances.Distinctions based upon gender will rarely be
                    reasonable because,in our society, as we now view the place of women in society, onlyextreme cases
                    based upon biological differences would probably beupheld. I mean, things like women in combat, only
                    men in combat.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">My time is up. Let me just make a final observation.What troubles me as I
                    hear your testimony, after having studiedyour writings and your opinions, is the very significant
                    and pronouncedshifts. You start as a socialist, you become a libertarian,you write a theory of
                    constitutional law in 1968, as you describedyesterday; you change that in 1971 on neutral
                    principles; you articulatethat doctrine in many speeches, dozens of speeches,through the seventies
                    and through the eighties. You are willing toassure us that you will apply Brandenburg, which you
                    think is fundamentallywrong, and a drastic change from your other writing.The concern I have is,
                    where's the predictability in Judge Bork?What are the assurances that this committee and the Senate
                    hasas to where you will be given the background and this history. Idon't know that you can really
                    answer that, but I would be pleasedto hear your comments.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">In the first place, Senator, the fact that as a teenagerand into my early
                    twenties I was a socialist hardly seems tome to indicate fundamental instability. As Winston
                    Churchill, Ithink it was, said, "Any man who's not a socialist before he's 40has no heart, and any
                    man who is a socialist after he's 40 has nohead." [Laughter.]I think that kind of evolution is very
                    common in people, verycommon.Now, the original intent philosophy I have been publishing nowfor 16
                    years, and I don't intend to move from it. Other things—Brandenburg, I have not shifted. I have said
                    to you that I wouldhave thought, as an initial matter, that advocacy of law violationcould be
                    prohibited when you're not using it to test the constitutionalityof a statute.I have also said the
                    Supreme Court added to that the fact thatadvocacy of law violation may be prohibited if lawless
                    behavior isimminent. I don't think they needed to add that. I am willing toaccept the fact that they
                    added that, as a judge. And my first obligationas a judge is not to write theoretical essays; it is
                    to decidecases and keep the law, insofar as possible, stable and continuous.</p>

                    response to SenatorLeahy on the pro bono work. One of the things that is importantfor a Justice on
                    the Court, or a judge on the federal bench, tohave is some understanding for those less fortunate in
                    our society.Are there other things that you have done with the less fortunatein your 60 years of
                    work, helping or volunteering to workwith the retarded or whatever it may be?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I thank you.Let me turn to another area of concern, and that is somethingwe
                    discussed yesterday. I said,One point, at a speech at Berkeley in 1985, you say "What a court adds
                    to oneperson's constitutional rights, it subtracts from the rights of others."That's a quote.Do you
                    believe that is always true?Judge BORK.Yes, Senator, I think it's a matter of plain arithmetic. I
                    think ourConstitution gives a constitutional right or a liberty in areas where the Bill ofRights or
                    the Civil War amendments don't prohibit it, citizens to sit down and electtheir representatives and
                    make their laws.If a court strikes down such laws on behalf of a plaintiff claiming liberty, it
                    automaticallydeprives the first group of its liberty. So what you're talking about here isa
                    redistribution of liberty.My concern is that we're not just talking about taking two orangesoff a
                    shelf and shifting them to another shelf, that there isno arithmetical equality here. Let's use the
                    case we used yesterday,of slavery. When you take away the liberty of a slave owner tohave slaves,
                    and grant liberty to those who are slaves, while I supposeyou are taking one right away from the
                    slave owner, the disparityis so great that it is important that that liberty be granted.</p>

                    the other person loses something. That's all.That is standard legal analysis. I don't think there's
                    any questionabout it.The fact is that in the case of slavery, we have the 13th amendmentbecause we
                    thought it was important to give slaves rights.We have the 14th amendment because we thought it was
                    importantto give former slaves rights, and the 15th amendment onvoting rights was equally because we
                    wanted to shift power orrights away from a ruling class that had it and give it to an underclassthat
                    needed it.I have no objection to that. I just say that one must recognizethat when you—when a
                    community passes a law because it, say,wants to prohibit something, and the court says that law is
                    invalid,it gives the people who object to the law liberty and takes it awayfrom the folks who wanted
                    the law.That's fine, and I like it, if it's in the Constitution. The Constitutionitself
                    redistributes rights and it's intended to, and it should.The only thing I have ever objected to was
                    the court doing it withoutconstitutional authority.</p>

                    an individualor a minority that "you may not be regulated in thisway", then the court has
                    redistributed the liberties without authorityfrom the Constitution. It is wrong to say they have

                    one example, but it's an obvious example. If a communitydecides that it wants to ban certain forms
                    of obscenity, becausethat obscenity impacts on their children, their family lifeand attitudes and
                    the moral environment, and if a court shouldcome along and say you may not ban that obscenity, so
                    that thepractice of showing obscene materials and so forth increases, Ithink the majority has lost
                    some liberties. Not everybody's libertyhas been expanded.Now, we can differ about that, but it seems
                    to me fairly evident.One of the great liberties we have is to govern ourselves throughrepresentative
                    bodies like the Senate and the House of Represent.If a court takes that away from us, we've lost a
                    liberty. Acourt ought to take it away from us if the Constitution says so. Itought not if the
                    Constitution does not say so. It should leave us theliberty of electing our Representatives and
                    Senators and havingthem make public policy for us.</p>

                    as I said I would. The Constitutionsays any person, and if you look at—that any person isprotected
                    under the equal protection clause—if you look at the language,which an original intention person
                    should, I think you'redriven to a reasonable basis test.Now, I am sure that the framers of that 14th
                    amendment did notthink that the way women were treated in those days was unreasonable.That was seen
                    to them very natural. Now, as women'splace in society has changed, all of those distinctions that
                    theymade and thought were entirely reasonable now look to us unreasonable.That's the way
                    constitutional doctrine evolves.</p>

                    in the pages that follow. We are nowtalking about a case—Let me back up.As a legislator, if I were a
                    legislator, I would clearly vote for thesmoke pollution ordinance and I would vote against the
                    anti-contraceptiveordinance, and as a citizen I would oppose the anti-contraceptivestatute and I
                    would vote for the smoke pollution statute.I am talking here about two cases in which, if there is
                    no constitutionalobjection to either statute, then a judge has no way of imposinghis moral
                    preferences upon the Constitution. That's all I'msaying. I'm saying the judge may not have a
                    hierarchy of valuesthat does not come from the Constitution. He may not say to a consumer,"You value
                    your low-cost electricity, but that's an ignoblevalue, whereas the other is a noble value" unless
                    the Constitutiontells him to make that choice.A legislator can make that moral distinction because a
                    legislatoris responsive to the people and must make moral choices all thetime. I think a judge is
                    supposed to enforce the morality of thepeople who made the law—in this case, the Constitution. That
                    isthe only reason I say the judge has no way to tell those two casesapart if the Constitution does
                    not speak.</p>

                    youare moving, perhaps somewhat reluctantly, and if not reluctantly,then after the fact, accepting

                    regarded as excesses by the Supreme Court. I didnot write about the ones that I thought were
                    approving. As amatter of fact, over the period of years I was discussing, I don'tsuppose I was
                    criticizing more than one or two Supreme Courtcases a year. When they made a proper expansion of
                    liberty, I didnot sit down and write an approving article. Perhaps I should have.It was only when I
                    thought a principle or a mode of decision thatwas coming into the law was not justified that I wrote
                    an article.That is why you will not see the other side. But, you know, Ihave said there are a lot of
                    opinions that I—I approve of most SupremeCourt opinions. Some of them expand liberty.</p>

                    various judicial theories, except that Ido not recall that anyone has questioned you about the
                    concept ofincorporating certain parts of the Bill of Rights into the due processclause of the 14th
                    amendment.That has been a highly debated and controversial area of jurisprudenceparticularly with
                    i;he Warren Court, and there were effortsmade, I think, first, to try to go through the privileges
                    andimmunities clause. Then they developed the concept of the dueprocess clause and the various
                    writings that had differed pertainingto that.Would you give us your feelings of whether or not this
                    was judicialactivism, judicial imperialism, or what is your feeling pertainingto the reasoning that
                    took place in the sort of selective incorporationtheory?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator Heflin, the historical evidence on that isstill coming in. When I
                    first went into teaching, I think the receivedwisdom was the article by Professor Fairman that
                    appearedin the Harvard Law Review, arguing that there really was not anyhistorical evidence for
                    incorporation. He was responding to JusticeBlack's opinion in the area. Since then, there has been
                    more evidencethat incorporation was intended.Now, it is perfectly clear, when we say
                    "incorporation," as youand I know but maybe not everybody who is listening to us does,we are talking
                    about the theory that the due process clause of the14th amendment applies against the States the
                    Bill of Rights whichoriginally applied only to the federal government. Since then, as Isay, there
                    has been more evidence which tends to show that incorporationwas intended. It is very clear that
                    Congressman Bingham,who wrote much of the clause and managed it in the House, andSenator Howard, I
                    think it is, who was the member of the committeethat drafted it and was the floor manager in the
                    Senate—bothof them clearly intended to incorporate not just the Bill of Rightsbut any personal
                    protection to be found in the Constitution, includingthe original Constitution.So there is some
                    pretty good historical evidence that it was intended.There is an argument whether the ratifying
                    conventionsunderstood that or not. I do not know the answer to that, but itseems to me that now the
                    Court has done it. It seems to me thatthere is some evidence that what they did was correct.In any
                    event, it seems to me a beneficial development and thoroughlyestablished, and I do not think anybody
                    really wants to seethe States free of the Bill of Rights. And as I say, I think there isconsiderable
                    historical evidence that it was intended, some that itwas not.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">In an article in the "District Lawyer," whichwas an interview between you
                    and an attorney you made somecomments on stare decisis, which means let the decision stand.Sometimes
                    I think we get very legalistic here, and the public thatis watching may have to run to the
                    dictionary. If it is not a lawdictionary, they may not find some of these terms. Maybe we willtry to
                    explain the term of precedents and the concept which is avery strong one, it provides certainty to
                    the law and predictabilityto affairs of persons, we follow the concept of let the decision
                    standafter they have been decided. I think maybe we should illustratethat.Anyway, you were asked a
                    question in that article, and the questionwas:That suggests that the principle of stare decisis may
                    be less weighty in constitutionalmatters than in statutory matters. Is that your view?And your
                    answer was,That has been the practice of courts throughout our history, and I am not preparedto say
                    it is wrong. There are some constitutional decisions around which somany other institutions and
                    people have built, that they have become part of thestructure of the nation. They ought not to be
                    overturned even if thought to bewrong. The example I usually give, because I think it is
                    non-controversial, is a broadinterpretation of the commerce power by the courts. So many statutes,
                    regulations,governmental institutions, private expectations and so forth have been built uparound
                    the broad interpretation of the commerce clause that it would be too lateeven if a Justice or a
                    judge became certain that the broad interpretation is wrong asa matter of original intent to tear it
                    up and overturn it.I assume that you still agree with your statement that is madethere.</p>

                    people have relied on precedents,a body of legal doctrine, your views would be that a Justice is
                    entitled as apart of his responsibility to re-examine constitutional questions de novo.Answer,I
                    would think that is true of a judge and true of a law court judge unless he isbound by a Supreme
                    Court precedent. After all, there are a lot of considerationsthat go into it. But at the bottom, a
                    judge's basic obligation or basic duty is to theConstitution, not simply the precedent.Now, is that
                    your thinking still today?</p>

                    Justice Brandeis and Justice Douglas.That has been the court's practice. I learned that in the first
                    yearof law school that judges respect precedent in all fields, but somewhatless so in constitutional
                    law than they do in statutory law. Iremember I learned that in my first class from then
                    ProfessorEdward Levi, later Attorney General, among many other things.And it is in his book,
                    "Introduction to Legal Reasoning."The Supreme Court has always said that, and many Justiceshave said
                    that. That is conventional wisdom.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I just got this. There was an article in theNational Review that had
                    excerpts where part of it was left out,that sort of thing. So my question is framed at the time and
                    thecontext of that as well as other writings that we have had, well,sort of excerpts from it. If it
                    is not fairly presented to you, let meknow. I want to be completely fair. But this is basically what
                    Igather the speech contained.What are the chances of restoring legitimacy to constitutional theory?
                    I thinkthey are excellent. My confidence is largely due to a law of nature I recently discov449ered.
                    To future generations, this will be known and revered as Bork's Wave Theoryof Law Reform. The courts
                    addressed what they regarded as serious social problemsafter World War II, and often did so without
                    regard to any recognizable theory ofconstitutional interpretation. A tradition of looking to
                    original intention was shattered.Constitutional theorists from academies, in sympathy with the
                    courts, politicallybegan to construct theories to justify what was happening. So was
                    non-originalismborn. That wave has become a tsunami—As I understand it, that is a hurricane
                    wave—Tsunami, and its intellectual and moral excesses are breathtaking. These theoristsexhort the
                    courts to unprecedented, imperialistic adventures, but the secondwave is rising. When I first wrote
                    on original intent in 1971, one of my colleagues atYale told a young visiting professor not to
                    bother with it because the position waspasse. So, indeed, it was. But it is more than passe. It was,
                    I think, the future aswell. There are many more younger people often associated with the Federalist
                    Societyand who are of that philosophy and who plan to go into law teaching. It maytake 10 years, it
                    may take 20 years for the second wave to crest, but crest it will,and it will sweep the elegant,
                    erudite, pretentious and toxic detritus of non-originalismout to sea.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I am not talking here at all about adhering to thelaw or to precedent. I am
                    talking here about the way constitutionaltheory is taught in the law schools. You will find that
                    most of thewriting now urges that one form or another of a moral philosophyis the way the
                    Constitution should be made up.When I said that "Constitutional theorists from the academiesare
                    exhorting the courts to unprecedented, imperialistic adventures"—and they are—I am talking here
                    about people of an oppositepoint of view of philosophy of original intention are going intoteaching,
                    and I think they are going to win the argument in theacademy. I am not talking about sweeping past
                    precedent out tosea. I am talking about sweeping the philosophy of non-originalism,of making up the
                    Constitution out of moral philosophy out to sea.This is not at all a discussion of what we are going
                    to do with thecases the Court has decided.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NO, no, Senator. This entire speech is a talk aboutconstitutional theorists
                    in the academy. I said on page 3, "The nonoriginalistsor non-interpretive theorists now dominate
                    constitutionaldebate," and later on in the past that you quoted, I said,"They are urging the Court
                    on to greater adventures," and theyare urging the courts on to greater adventures.But the people I
                    dealt with, for example, I disagreed here. Thefirst person I disagreed with who had a
                    non-originalist philosophyoriginally when he started out was Prof. Alexander Bickel, mygood friend.
                    This entire business is about legal academics. I think ifyou read it you will see it is an argument
                    with professors abouthow to deal with the Constitution. That dramatic language aboutsunamis and
                    sweeping the toxis de tractus out to sea is about thetheories that are current in the academy, which
                    I must say nocourt has even gone anywhere near as far as some professors thinkthey should, and are
                    urging them to, to create constitutional law.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">SO it may well be that in the presentation formit may well have been
                    misrepresented.I continue to look at you, your complexities, look at your opposition,and there are
                    certain aspects of this that give me problems.One. for example, is that you came up for Solicitor
                    General. Mostof the writings that have been referred here today were writingsthat occurred before
                    that time. You were questioned somewhatabout some of those writings at that Solicitor General's
                    hearing.Senator Tunney went into it in some detail.In effect, you admitted the writings and had some
                    of those viewsthen, but said that would not bother you. You were a lawyer, andit would not keep you
                    from representing the Government's positioneven if you had personal contrary views to a position
                    that youmight be called upon to take as a Solicitor General.Then you came up for hearings in the
                    Judiciary Committeeagain in 1982. I believe the Solicitor General was about 1973. In1982 you had a
                    hearing pertaining to the District Court of Appeals,the position that you are on. You were
                    questioned about some ofthe writings, some of those in detail. But you were not really opposed.The
                    civil rights groups, the others did not make a battleagainst you.Now, this causes me concern of why
                    they did not make a battlethen and are making a battle now. There is some sort of concept ofstatute
                    of limitations, laches, other things of this sort that I thinka person has to bear in mind on this.
                    Some people feel that theissue of abortion is so dominant in this that it has influenced otherpeople
                    who really are not associated particularly in that one specificfield.Now, I suppose this is an area
                    that deserves consideration, justlike every other area. You are very complex, as I pointed out,
                    inprevious questions as to what you will do. Frankly, I do not know. Isaid I ought to be a
                    psychiatrist, and I really think that I wouldhave to be more than a psychiatrist to try to look at
                    your backgroundand make some predictability.But do you want to respond to this? I think this is a
                    legitimatearea. Basically, of all of these things, your previous hearings—well,I suppose it is on
                    the concept of sort of like a statute of limitations.Do you want to respond to that?</p>

                    since I have been on the court, my recordhas not been one they can object to. We have been over this
                    in thearea of minorities and women. In eight cases involving substantiveissues, I have voted for the
                    claim of the minority or the womanseven times out of eight. In labor cases, I have a lot of votes
                    forlabor unions and employees. So nothing that has happened in thepast 5x/2 years seems to me to
                    provide any basis for opposition now.I would think it was quite the other way around. They should
                    havebeen more exercised on the basis of some theoretical things I hadsaid before becoming a judge
                    than they are on the things I havedone as a judge, than they should be on the things I have done as

                    whereif you were to follow the agenda that they fear you follow, that youcould do terrible harm to

                    known, more widely known than any views of minebefore have ever been.It really would be preposterous

                <p class="short_transcript">I have found some writings that you have madethat would indicate that you
                    took strong positions at times whichwould have meant that you believed in equal treatment of
                    blacks,and came at a time when the heat was almost as much as the heatis now on the issue of
                    abortion. That is the busing issue. I found inthe testimony that you testified before a House
                    Committee on theequal education opportunities in 1972—and I think that was prettywell the height of
                    the busing fire that was raging in the country—that you testified at that time,I would be clear
                    about this. Congress certainly may not identify all remedies forsegregation. I do not think Congress
                    could even completely ban busing as a singleremedy. As the court noted in the strong opinion
                    involving the North Carolinabusing statutes, there are cases in which busing is essential to the
                    vindication of aconstitutional right. I would think it highly doubtful that Congress would banbusing
                    and have that statute stand up in court.This would indicate not only your stand on busing, but it
                    wouldindicate that the Supreme Court has the constitutional right tostructure remedies, and you do
                    not feel that Congress can takeaway from the court the availability of judicial remedies in
                    carryingout the decisions.Now, do you want to comment on that particular one?</p>

                    opposed was busing that went far beyond theoriginal violation of law. It was much beyond what was
                    necessaryto cure the violation of law. That is a standard principle, as weboth know, of equitable
                    remedies. The remedy is as broad as theviolation.Now, I filed a brief like in the Austin, Texas,
                    case which was remanded,so the Supreme Court did not decide the issue. But later,in the Carter
                    administration, in the Dayton busing case—Dayton I,I think it was—the Carter administration filed a
                    brief signed byGriffin Bell and by Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney General forCivil Rights, which
                    took the identical position I had taken on thissubject; and the Supreme Court accepted it eight to
                    nothing, theprinciple that you do not create a remedy much broader thanneeded to cure the effects of
                    the violation.The position I have taken on that is now the law of the land.</p>

                    had the pleasure of escortingsome of our counterparts from Pakistan—that is, democraticallyelected
                    representatives of their Parliament—on to the floor of theSenate this morning.It is always nice to
                    examine a bright spot in the world, is it not?There is a nation that has risen from martial law and
                    in which democracyand the rule of law, the law made by legislators, not bygenerals or judges, is on
                    the ascendance.Well, Judge, this is day four and the game is in the fourth quarter,and I think you
                    are doing very well, indeed. The nuance iscoming out, the nuance of Judge Bork the judge and Judge
                    Borkthe person. I was impressed by one of those nuances which cameout. I have forgotten which
                    Senator on the Democratic end broughtit up, but it was about the fact that you as a very young
                    lawyer, ajunior member of your firm, confronted some crusty old curmudgeonswith 30 or 40 years'
                    service to that firm, senior partners, andsaid, look, this Jewish quota business is dumb. I am
                    putting wordsin your mouth. You were probably a little more diplomatic as avery junior member, but
                    you confronted the establishment onbehalf of a man you did not even known, you barely knew, butwhose
                    credentials, I guess, impressed you. That vignette is impressiveto me.Here is another one, published
                    yesterday in an op-ed piece by aman named Stewart A. Smith, who practices law in New YorkCity. I do
                    not know Stewart Smith from Adam, any more than Iknew you from Adam until you walked into this room
                    the otherday. It is entitled, "Bork Deserves to be a Justice."Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous
                    consent that this piece beprinted in the record.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you.Thank you. Let me just read a few passagesfrom this by Stewart
                    Smith.I served as tax assistant under three different Solicitors General during bothDemocratic and
                    Republican administrations, including Judge Bork's tenure from1973 to 1977, and I can attest on the
                    basis of personal observation that his conductas the Government's chief lawyer before the Supreme
                    Court was marked by intellectualhonestly, integrity and a professionalism much appreciated by the
                    court itself.Then skipping on to the last three or four paragraphs,A second episode illustrates in
                    another way his professionalism and integrity. Ablack man had been convicted in a southern State of
                    various drug and criminalincome tax charges. In his petition for Supreme Court review, the
                    defendantclaimed that the Government's principal witness had committed perjury. As thelawyer
                    responsible for presenting the Government's tax cases to the Supreme Court,I directed that an
                    independent evaluation be made and concluded that the defendant'sclaim was factually
                    correct.Accordingly, I recommended to Mr. Bork that the Government confess error andask the Supreme
                    Court to return the case to the court of appeals to consider whetherthe conviction should be
                    reversed.So here is the situation. The spring is all wound up. The Governmentis already to go in the
                    case before the Supreme Court, andhere comes this little junior attorney to Robert Bork who
                    said,Wait a minute. The defendant is right. The defendant is right. We had better pullin our horns
                    as embarrassing as it may be.Continuing,The Solicitor General Bork unhesitantly agreed with my
                    recommendation. Hetook this principled action despite the strong protests of the local U.S.
                    attorney. AsMr. Bork saw the matter, the Government's criminal prosecutions had to be conductedwith
                    the utmost fairness, and the Government owed a special obligation tothe Supreme Court to admit when
                    the process had been defective, whatever the costmight be. A lesser man would have yielded to
                    institutional pressures and deprived ablack man—It does not matter what his color was, but that is
                    what Smithsays—Deprived a black man of his rights in order to protect the reputation of
                    anotherfederal officer. It is fortunate when a person of Judge Bork's demonstrated abilitycomes to
                    national prominence.Indeed. My remark.It is even more fortunate when a person of Judge Bork's
                    professionalism does, aprofessionalism that guides him always when dealing with the powerful and
                    thepowerless to act with utmost honesty and responsibility. Judge Bork would enhance,indeed grace,
                    the important work of our nation's highest tribunal.Well, I can tell you, you certainly graced the
                    confines of thismarble inquisitorial hall these last 4 days, Judge.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">SO I have come to admire you and respectyou, as I expected, but I have also
                    come to be very fond of you as ahuman being. You have stood the attacks well. You have beenunder
                    fire. Some very stinky stink bombs have been dropped onyour head these last 2 months, including some
                    in this room, Iregret to say.Here we are in the fourth day, and perhaps it is worth a
                    briefrecapitulation of where we are.It is interesting to me and I am sure it is interesting to you,
                    thatyour antagonists, your opponents insist upon focusing almost exclusivelyon your writings as a
                    college professor. They say that thecases you have decided, your record on the second-most
                    importantcourt in the country over the last 5 years is irrelevant. We havedemolished that charge
                    because, in fact, circuit court judges dohave a lot of leeway in the sense that cases do not come
                    before youin neat little packages that fit into neat little Supreme Court precedentpigeonholes.
                    There is a lot of latitude.In any event, you said that you would have decided all of thosecases the
                    same way—I am speaking of the seven of eight civilrights cases in which you upheld the claim of a
                    minority or awoman plaintiff or person—that you would have decided all ofthose cases the same way
                    had you been on the Supreme Court.Nonetheless, the point I am trying to make is this, that the
                    opponentsinsist upon focusing on your record, almost exclusively, yourrecord as a college professor
                    and your writings, while suggestingthat your record as a judge is irrelevant, that your record as
                    SolicitorGeneral is irrelevant, with the exception of Watergate, ofcourse. It is all irrelevant
                    except for the Cox episode. That is relevant.That is an interesting selectivity, isn't it?Well, we
                    have established that, contrary to the remarks about noroom at the inn and no place in the
                    Constitution and all that baloney,that you stood for minority and women parties in the seven ofthe
                    eight cases that came before you in your capacity on the D.C.Circuit Court where substantive civil
                    rights issues that were at contest.I want to focus further, and this will duplicate, I think,
                    overlapsomewhat the fine efforts of Senator Hatch yesterday, looking atsome of these amicus briefs
                    that you filed. After all, the chargesagainst you, the false charges, have been repeated over and
                    over soit does not hurt to overlap a little bit in your defense.Now, what about this parallel charge
                    that your record as SolicitorGeneral does not matter because you were working for a clientand,
                    implied in that, is that you just followed orders? Is that so?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">You're trying to apply the law too broadly.It is interesting to note that
                    Justice Powell, the man whom youwill replace if confirmed, voted to reject your expansive
                    interpretation.It is interesting to note also that Justice White, PresidentKennedy's nominee to the
                    Supreme Court, also rejected the expansiveinterpretation which you argued in your brief. Nobody
                    questionsthe commitment of Justices Powell and White or PresidentKennedy to equality before the law
                    for all of our citizens.Let's talk about another 1976 case, Runyon v. McCrary. You filedan amicus
                    brief arguing that Section 1981 of the Post-Civil WarCivil Rights Act could be applied to private
                    schools which excludedqualified children because they were black. Do you recall any pertinentdetails
                    of that?</p>

                    failing to establish a program to assist non-English speaking students, such as Chinese and

                    concurred with most of theruling, but felt that the decision went too far in setting very
                    strictstandards than an employer had to meet in validating employmentscreening tests. In other
                    words, Justices Burger and Blackmun didnot want to go as far as you argued in your amicus brief. I
                    havenot heard anybody call or allege racism on the part of Blackmunand Burger.Another important case
                    where you submitted an amicus wasFranks v. Bowman Transportation, 1976. In that case, in your
                    brief,you sided with black class action plaintiffs, seeking to establishthat minority victims of
                    employment discrimination could beawarded retroactive seniority relief. That was 11 years ago and
                    Ishould not keep asking you if you remember the details.I am putting you in a bad light so do not
                    ask me any questionslike that. I do not want to be put in that light myself, even withrespect to
                    legislation of last year, because as soon as you dispose ofone pressing issue, two more fall on your
                    head around here and itall becomes a blur after just a few months, not to mention years.To get back
                    to Franks v. Bowman, a class action suit on behalf ofblack citizens, Justice Powell, while
                    concurring a part of the majorityopinion, dissented against the Court's very broad interpretationof
                    retroactive seniority rights, as did Chief Justice Burger and JusticeRehnquist. Nobody has
                    questioned their commitment to civilrights laws.Let's look at one more here—this is not an amicus
                    case, but tellsthe same story, the case United Jewish Organizations v. Carey—Governor Carey of New
                    York.</p>

                    issuesthat we have been discussing are complex, and if they were not difficultthey would not be

                <p class="short_transcript">Let's turn to criminal law. We have notdone much in that area, in the sense
                    of criminal law as it relates toindividual citizens.The President's Working Group on the Family
                    said, in its reporton the family last year, "Crime is the crudest tax of all on theAmerican family,
                    a regressive levy that burdens those least able tobear its exactions." How very true.And I say this
                    is an issue of importance to individual citizens becausethe statistics show that nearly every one of
                    us, at sometimein our life, will be a victim of crime, and that is if we are lucky,because lots of
                    people are multiple victims of crime.That is, they are victims of criminals on multiple
                    occasions,whether it is the breaking and entry of an automobile, or a home,or assault, or fraud, or
                    murder. It is very, very common, and it is avery real threat to every American. I will give you a
                    case.Just a few doors down from where I live here in the District—Ishould not say live here. I sleep
                    here. I live in New Hampshire. Butanyhow, a few doors down from where I sleep after I totter onhome
                    from this institution, there is a lady who is living in thehome her father built, many years ago,
                    obviously.She is a lady, a woman who works outside the home. She is asingle person. And her home has
                    been broken into, not once, nottwice, three times, to the point where she had to literally put
                    steelbars on her windows. The home her father built, in which she haslived her entire life. She
                    lives behind bars in her own home.And in some of those robberies, she has lost things of very
                    greatpersonal value, not monetary value, necessarily, I do not know, butthings that—you
                    know—heirlooms, family items.And so that is not an isolated case. We have got lots of elderlypeople
                    living behind chained doors in fear of their safety. We havegot parents all over this country who
                    worry about their kids on theway home, or on the way to school.Ordinary citizens, able-bodied
                    citizens worry about walking downa dark street at night. So this issue of crime is a very real
                    andpractical concern to our citizens.Now I want to ask you: we have heard a lot about the rights
                    ofcriminals here so far, and that is not an unimportant thing, becausewe are only as secure as the
                    least secure member of our societyin our rights.But let's talk about the rights of law-abiding
                    citizens. What responsibilitydo judges have to protect society and individual citizensfrom
                    criminals?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, judges can do a limited amount, of course, butI think a judge has two
                    responsibilities. One is to ensure that anyaccused gets a fair, completely fair trial, so that he is
                    not prejudicedin any way.But the other responsibility is not to elaborate legal doctrine sothat the
                    appeal becomes a game, and somebody gets off on a technicality,which has nothing to do with
                    fairness.That is a very broad statement and I am not an expert on criminallaw, but I have
                    participated in reversals of convictions and ofreversals of sentencing because the trial had a
                    serious error in itwhich meant we could not be sure it was fair, or because thedouble jeopardy
                    clause was violated.On the other hand, I do not go looking for a new wrinkle thathas nothing to do
                    with the basic fairness.</p>

                    outrageous disposition of a criminalcase. It is the 1984 case of Nicks v. Williams. It came out of
                    Iowa.A 10-year-old little girl disappeared on Christmas Eve. It turnedout she had been brutally
                    murdered by a man named Robert Williams.Williams voluntarily surrendered to the police. He was read
                    hisrights. He did not confess, and, on the advice of counsel, he remainedsilent.While he was in the
                    custody of the police, one of the officers describedhow difficult it would be to find the little
                    girl's body. See,he had already confessed, but they had not found the body nor hadhe revealed its
                    location.How difficult it would be because snow was falling, and how distressedthe parents would be,
                    on top of their loss, if the child's bodycould not even be given a decent burial.The officer did not
                    question Williams, just pricked his consciencea little bit, and Williams later, subsequently
                    volunteered the location.The body was found and evidence was used to convict Williamsof the
                    murder.And the court found that in any event, the body would have beenfound even without Williams'
                    cooperation. He was convicted. Thecourt of appeals reversed the conviction on the theory that
                    theState had to prove that the officer had not acted in bad faith inappealing to Williams'
                    conscience.Williams had not been interrogated, had not been coerced in anyway, he had been read his
                    rights, but that was not good enough forthese judges, or, a majority of them anyway.My time is just
                    about up.</p>

                    how—assuming theranking member agrees—how we will finish out the morning andthen move into the
                    afternoon.We are now finished with the last round of questioning, and wewill begin again. Some
                    members have questions, not all will, andsome have questions that will not last a full 30 minutes.So
                    what I am going to do is to withhold asking my questions atthis point.Senator Metzenbaum is next in
                    line.He tells me he has somequestions, maybe not many, and then I will yield to Senator Thurmondwho
                    would be next, alternating again.Well, actually, I guess I should yield, since this is the next
                    round,I will yield to Senator Thurmond for his questions, for about 10 or15 minutes, and then yield
                    to Senator Metzenbaum, who is inabout the same situation.Then we will break for lunch, and then we
                    will come back andcomplete the next round of questioning.So I will yield to Senator Thurmond for his
                    round, and then toSenator Metzenbaum.</p>

                    if one begins to identify a professor's writingswith what he, or she will do as a judge, I am afraid
                    there aregoing to be a lot of young professors watching these hearings, whowill decide that being
                    non-controversial is the best approach to acareer.But as a matter of fact, a professor is absolutely
                    free to speculate,to think, to try out arguments. As my good friend Alex Bickelused to say, all
                    writing is an experiment, and that is what it is.You start a debate, and then some of your stuff
                    stands up, some ofit does not.As a judge, you are responsible to the law, and not to some
                    speculativetheory you once developed. You are responsible for continuity,you are responsible for
                    justice, you are responsible to be com465passionate to individuals, none of which necessarily
                    appears in aprofessor's writing.As I have said before in these hearings, and I have said in
                    privateto one Senator—Senator Specter—in the classroom nobodygets hurt. In a courtroom, somebody
                    always does. And that is awholly different function than being a professor.</p>

                    of first amendment rights andthe equal protection clause, as well as others.You have also indicated
                    that some of these decisions are acceptedlaw, and should not be disturbed by the Supreme Court.This
                    has been taken by some as a change in your views, in orderto enhance the probability of your

                <p class="short_transcript">From the beginning of these hearings, Senator, Ihave said that I think the
                    ultimate touchstone for a judge is theintention of the lawmaker, and in constitutional law—in fact
                    it isnot the intention, it is the original understanding of what that provisionmeant.And in
                    constitutional law that means what the ratifiers understoodwhen they ratified the Constitution. But
                    I have also said thatthe law has developed, and the nation has developed, and decisionshave been
                    made around which too much has been built, andaround which too many expectations have clustered, for
                    them to beoverruled.Now I might disagree with a lot of decisions, over time, althoughas I have said,
                    the large majority of Supreme Court decisions Iagree with. But I have given examples here, you know,
                    of casesthat just are not to be overruled. I am trying to remember the examples.I have given
                    examples in my speeches. The commerce clausecases cannot be overruled. You cannot cut the commerce
                    clauseback.The legal tender cases authorizing paper money cannot be overruled,no matter what the
                    original understanding was. The equalprotection clause cases cannot be overruled. I mean, the
                    extensionof the equal protection clause cannot be overruled.I have mentioned some first amendment
                    cases that cannot beoverruled. I have mentioned a lot of cases that I think are nowpart of our law,
                    and whatever theoretical challenges might be levelledat them, it is simply too late for any judge to
                    try to tear it up,too late for a judge to overrule them.Incorporation doctrine I mentioned this
                    morning in connectionwith Senator Heflin's questions, is also something that is now
                    thoroughlyestablished. I do not know that incorporation is contrary tooriginal understanding,
                    because the evidence goes both ways, but ifit is, nonetheless, that doctrine is established.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, I spend a lot of my time looking for discountstores. I do like
                    discount stores. Typically, in a market, therewill be consumers who respond to lower prices, other
                    consumerswill respond to the provision of service or information.One manufacturer might decide to
                    fix the prices of his retailerson his products alone, in order to encourage those retailers to
                    provideservice and information, compete through service and information.Another manufacturer will go
                    for the segment of the marketwhich is responsive to price, and will not fix the prices of his
                    retailers,and in that way, consumers get a choice between a low price orbetween the provision of
                    service and information.Sometimes, the same manufacturer will do both. He will haveone brand that is
                    price-maintained and one brand that is not, so hecan hit both segments of the market.I certainly
                    would not advocate anything that would result inwiping out discount stores, they are a very valuable
                    institution,and I personally look for them.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, in this hearing we have alreadytalked about your views on one
                    sterilization case.There is another one I want to discuss with you, the AmericanCyanamid case that
                    you decided in 1984.The Occupational Safety and Health Act, a statute that Congresspassed to protect
                    the workers of this country says that, quote:"Each employer shall furnish to each of his employees a
                    place ofemployment free from recognized hazards that are likely to causedeath or serious physical
                    harm to his employees." End of quote.American Cyanamid operated a department which exposedwomen to
                    lead, a substance which causes harm to a developingfetus. The company offered the women of the
                    department a horriblechoice.The women could quit their jobs, or, they could keep their jobsand be
                    sterilized.The company called this a fetus protection policy. It was really apolicy of be sterilized
                    or be fired. You wrote the opinion allowingthe company to maintain this policy.Judge Bork, there
                    were 30 women working for the Cyanamidcompany when the company adopted the
                    be-sterilized-or-firedpolicy. This policy forced 23 of those women to be sterilized or befired. Five
                    were actually sterilized before the lawsuit was filed. Cyanamidforced over 75 percent of their women
                    employees to choosebetween their jobs and the possibility of ever having children.Judge, I must tell
                    you that it is such a shocking decision, and Icannot understand how you as a jurist could put women
                    to thechoice of work or be sterilized, and I would think you are entitledto comment on how you
                    arrived at that decision.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I would be glad to, Senator. I am just trying torecall the case. That was a
                    unanimous decision joined in by JudgeScalia—now Justice Scalia—and Senior District Judge
                    Williamsfrom California. What we did, as I recall, was affirm the decision ofthe Occupational Safety
                    and Health Administration. That is,OSHA, the agency which is responsible for protecting safety in
                    theworkplace had already decided this way and we affirmed it.Now, as I wrote, it is important to
                    understand the context inwhich this case arose and the task that is set for this court.
                    AmericanCyanamid found and the administrative law judge agreed thatit could not reduce ambient lead
                    levels in one of its departmentssufficiently to eliminate the risk of serious harm to fetuses
                    carriedby women employees.The company was thus confronted with unattractive alternatives.It could
                    remove all women of child bearing age from that department—a decision that would have entailed
                    discharging some ofthem and giving others reduced pay at other jobs—or the companycould attempt to
                    mitigate the severity of this outcome by offeringcontinued employment in the department to women who
                    weresterilized.The company chose the latter alternative and the women involvedwere thus faced with a
                    distressing choice. Some chose sterilization.Some did not. The fact is, if they had not offered
                    thatchoice, these women would have been put in lower paying jobs orwould have been discharged. They
                    offered a choice to the women.Some of them, I guess, did not want to have children.My opinion is not
                    an endorsement of a sterilization policy. As Inoted, the policy might—in the opinion—the policy
                    might be anunfair labor practice or a form of employment discriminationunder title VII. Indeed, the
                    union and the women employees hadsued the employer under title VII and had reached a settlementwith
                    that employer.The basis of the decision was Congress' intent. Since the words ofthe act, "recognized
                    hazards" were somewhat ambiguous, welooked at legislative history and cases interpreting similar
                    languagein other federal laws. My opinion concluded that Congresshad been concerned with physical
                    conditions of the workplace, notwith policies offering women a choice.And my opinion was narrow. I
                    said that the case might be differentif the employer had offered the choice of sterilization in
                    orderto maintain an unlawfully high lead level, but the fact is the companycould not get the lead
                    levels down and the company wascharged only because it offered women a choice.I think that is not a
                    pro sterilization opinion. It is not an antiwomanopinion. It is simply upholding a federal agency to
                    whichwe owe deference in deciding—when you review a federal agencyyou are supposed to defer to their
                    judgment if it is not outside thebounds of rationality—and the union conceded in oral argumentthat
                    the company could lawfully have stated that only sterilewomen would be employed in the department.So
                    this case is simply about offering women who did not want tobe discharged or sent to lower paying
                    jobs a choice. That is all itwas about.</p>

                    Occupational Safety and Health Administrationcame in with that position. You know, I am sure, that
                    theLabor Secretary said that the policy should be barred. And youcannot tell me, Judge, that any
                    Member of Congress said orthought that a safer workplace could be achieved at the expense offorced
                    sterilization.Congress said, no hazards in the workplace, but you wrote anopinion which said it was
                    okay for a company to achieve safety atthe expense of women by preventing its female employees
                    fromever having children. I have to say to you that that is a distortionof the statute beyond
                    recognition. I think it is unfair. I think it isinhumane, and maybe it somehow explains the concerns
                    thatwomen of this country have and have evidenced about your appointment.</p>

                    there. Thecompany did not achieve safety at the expense of women. Theycould not get the lead levels

                    of getting the levels down.Now, if this opinion were not a fair one, I would not have gottena
                    unanimous panel from Judges Scalia and Williams and I wouldnot have been able to uphold that opinion
                    over a petition for rehearingen bane, to have the full court. I think there were 11 membersof our

                    routinely relied upon thefact that this judge or that judge agreed with you. You have saidthat
                    certain other legal scholars agreed with you. You have nottalked much about the great body of those
                    who have disagreed withyou.You say ignore your academic writings, that you they are
                    merelyspeculative. You told Senator Thurmond this morning you weretrying out arguments. That is part
                    of the process to start a debateas an academician. And you would say, look at your record on
                    thecourt, it is much more reliable.You have talked about several occasions, seven out of eight
                    casesthat you decided as the circuit court of appeals. I have asked theJustice Department to make
                    those available to me during therecess. I do not have them. I do not know what they say. I do
                    notknow whether they are distinguishable. But I cannot tell youstrongly enough that the women of
                    this country are terribly, terriblyapprehensive about your appointment.I have traveled throughout
                    Ohio. I have traveled throughout thecountry, and it is unbelievable to me the kinds of people that
                    comeup to me—a clerk, a woman who was from an economically strongsocial group, you get on an
                    elevator, you walk past somebody in ahallway—and the women's groups, frankly, are afraid. They
                    areafraid of you.Yesterday you said, women and blacks who know your record onthe court need not fear
                    you. But the fact is, Judge Bork, they dofear you. They are concerned. They are frightened. They
                    were notenthused about Sandra Day O'Connor or Rehnquist or Scalia. Butthey were not frightened by
                    that appointment.The women of America, in my opinion, have much to be worriedabout in connection
                    with your appointment; the blacks as well.And it is only fair to say that you have made it quite
                    clear in yourappearance before this panel that you are not a frightening man,but you are a man with
                    frightening views.</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Well, thank you, Senator. Let me respond briefly tothat.In the first place,
                    I think your discussion took off from the pointof this particular case, and I must say to you that
                    the entire OccupationalSafety and Health Administration agreed with me. It wasa unanimous panel
                    opinion and you say nobody was afraid of JusticeScalia. Justice Scalia was on this opinion. Our
                    court did notrehear this case en bane.That means they did not think it was an outrageous case. And
                    itwas a matter of statutory interpretation, not a matter of constitutionallaw, and I suppose the 5
                    women who chose to stay on thatjob with higher pay and chose sterilization—I suppose that theywere
                    glad to have the choice—they apparently were—that the companygave them.But let me go on to your
                    broader charge. I cannot say thisenough times. You know, beginning with Brown v. Board of EducationI
                    have supported black equality. And I have done that in printlong before I got here.I have never said
                    anything or decided anything that should befrightening to women. You are undoubtedly correct,
                    Senator, thatthere are women who are apprehensive. I think it can only be becausethey do not know my
                    record. I have repeatedly showed youthe cases I have decided on the court of appeals in which I
                    havevoted for women.In addition to that, there is no reason for consumers to fear mebecause in so
                    far as we are talking about the antitrust law, I amguided entirely by my best understanding of what
                    is good for consumers.And if I am persuaded that something else is good for consumers,I will go that
                    way. There is no doubt about it.If you now turn to the Constitution and my allegedly narrowviews of
                    that, if you will look at my first amendment decisions youwill see that in cases I have taken a
                    broad view of the first amendment.If you will look at my decision that came down recently—which was
                    assigned to me long before I was nominated and wevoted that way long before I was nominated—I have
                    taken a broadview of the double jeopardy clause in favor of a sentenced person.If you will look at
                    what I have stated about the equal protectionclause, you will see it as a better view—I think it is
                    a better view—than one that a lot of people take who exclude groups from equalprotection.In sum,
                    Senator, I think there is no basis for the concern you describeamong women and blacks and I regret
                    to say, I think thereis no basis for the charges you have leveled at me.</p>

                    or questionable or at least requirecloser examination.Some people go back and re-examine the
                    rationale of Marbury v.Madison, which established judicial review in 1803. That is allright as an
                    academic. I do not happen to do that. I happen to thinkMarbury v. Madison was correctly decided. But
                    some people do dothat.But I cannot imagine anybody who did that, if he got on a court,saying he was
                    going to overrule Marbury v. Madison. This just isnot done.</p>

                    words, to protect the constitutional valuethat we are trying to protect. That is what judges do.
                    Academicscan sit back and criticize and find fault or sustain or find supportfor some of these
                    viewpoints.Judges do follow precedent.They follow a whole line foundedyears before and academics are
                    constantly seeking for new lines—new ways of solving their conjectural approaches, new ways ofmaybe
                    re-drawing the lines in ways in which they should not havebeen drawn in the first place. I think
                    that is a fair statement. Doyou feel that the distinction between judge and academic explainsthe
                    distinctions between you as a professor and you as a judge—explain apparent inconsistencies, but in
                    fact, may not even be inconsistent,but are merely changes in roles?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Sumter County had moved from a method of selectingtheir county council from
                    a district voting to an at-large votingsystem and the Attorney General had refused to clear that
                    underthe Voting Rights Act. They are required to go and get clearancefrom the Department of Justice.
                    If they cannot get clearance, thenthey go to court and challenge it and say they are entitled to
                    clearance.They had basically two arguments. As I recall, one was that theywere not required to
                    pre-clear because they had already had it oncebefore or something of that sort. We ruled against
                    them on that.That was sort of a factual legal issue. The other thing they had toestablish was that
                    the at-large system was not adopted with theintent or the effect of diluting black voting strength
                    and we ruled,on the evidence, that they had failed to prove that it did not havethat intent or
                    effect and so we ruled against the Sumter CountyCouncil and for the blacks who wanted a districting
                    system againinstead of an at-large election system.</p>

                    interpretations of the Voting Rights Act. In fact,Justice Powell voted against minority plaintiffs
                    in 17 out of 25voting rights cases that he decided.I think I have concluded, or I am beginning to
                    conclude, that mycritical colleagues might not have confirmed Justice Powell if hewere sitting in
                    your shoes today. But, in fact, our memory may behasty, but Justice Powell was opposed by some
                    selective civil rightsgroups when he came before the Senate in 1971. After all, he favoredmany
                    narrower constructions of the Civil Rights laws thanyou have.</p>

                    think is necessarily the case here—Ithink it is a fallacious argument. I think these matters, if
                    youreally look at the facts and your actions, which speak louder thanthe words of some of those who
                    have been critics of you, you findthat you stand in very good stead with regard to some of the

                    Northwest Airlines. This concerned the applicabilityof the Equal Pay Act to airline stewardesses. In
                    that instance,you found that female stewardesses may not be paid lessthan male pursers.</p>

                    have been stated here. They statethese broad-brushed generalities but apparently, have not readyour
                    cases or have not looked at what you have done or have notseen what your actions have been. In other
                    words, in the hysteriaof being afraid of having somebody they brand "conservative" onthe Court, it
                    seems to me there is a wholesale misrepresentation ofwhat you stand for and what your actions have
                    really been. Youhave to resent that. I resent it. I think it is an abomination and yetthat is the
                    type of rhetoric you are getting in this manner.To return to your record on the bench, we could
                    examine caseafter case which would show an inclination to uphold civil rights.Let me take just one
                    other case and that is the case of Emory v.Secretary of the Navy.That involved the application of
                    civil rightsreview to the Navy's promotion decisions, if you will recall thatcase.</p>

                    howmany of these cases, the Palmer case, the Wick case, the Emorycase, were cases in which you voted
                    to reverse a lower court whichhad ruled against civil rights plaintiffs. I find that a striking
                    consideration.The special interest groups opposing you, purport toreview your record based only on a
                    small fraction of the cases thatyou have heard and these were the non-unanimous cases. Theyonly
                    comprise about 14 percent of your total cases.</p>

                    review because the three-judgepanels were unanimous, despite the fact that the lower court hadruled
                    the other way. Again, it shows the bigoted bias on the part ofthose who did the reviews of your
                    record. It shows how they havetried to scuttle your nomination, I think, for very
                    inappropriatereasons. They have ignored what your record really is. That bothersme a lot and it has
                    got to bother anybody who is fair in thiscountry. It certainly has got to bother you.If you look at
                    other cases, such as Norris v. D.C. where you rejecteda district court's attempt to dismiss a
                    plaintiffs complaint ofmis-treatment or Doe v. Weinberger where you ruled against theGovernment and
                    ensured that a homosexual was accorded full dueprocess rights. Those are important cases. They may
                    be just everydayaffairs to you, where I think you came out very, very wellagainst your critics. In
                    fact, I think in all your cases, you came outpretty doggone well against your critics.Your critics
                    have not come out well in these hearings, nor havethey come out well given your answers, nor have
                    they come outwell on the facts. They have distorted the facts. They have misusedstatistics. They
                    have distorted your opinions. Why are they doingthis? They cannot attack your intellect. They cannot
                    attack you asa good judge. They cannot attack your ethics. They cannot attackyour work effort. I
                    guess the only way they can do it is unfairly.That is really what it comes down to and when it is
                    attackedthat way, when you are attacked that way, that is what I call pureand simple politics. That
                    is really what is involved here. I thinkthat is what is coming out. I think your actions speak a lot
                    louderthan their words and frankly, you have consistently voted to preservefundamental
                    constitutional rights. I do not think there is anyquestion about that. You agree with that, don't

                    statutory question of whether offeringthe choice, the option, was a hazard in the workplace. WhenI
                    was discussing this case with Senator Metzenbaum, I said thatOSHA, the Occupational Safety and
                    Health Administration, said itwas not a hazard. I was wrong about that. The Occupational Safetyand
                    Health Administration said it was a hazard. It was the OccupationalSafety and Health Review
                    Commission that reviewedOSHA's decision that rejected that and said it was not a hazard.We affirmed
                    OSHA on the grounds of offering a choice; no force,no coercion, just offering a choice for the women
                    who really wantedto keep those jobs. It was not a hazard. That was a unanimouspanel. There was no
                    attempt that I can recall; certainly, we did notrehear it en bane so apparently the full court did
                    not regard it asan outrageous decision or a troublesome decision. The Secretary ofLabor did not
                    appeal, did not try to go to the Supreme Court.It was a sad choice these women employees had to
                    make. It wasvery distressing. The only question was, should they be given achoice? And is giving
                    them a choice a hazard? We did not think itwas under the act.</p>

                    not looked at these matters andhave not looked at them carefully. I think you deserve that type
                    oftreatment for this type of a position, and it really should not be apolitical decision. It ought
                    to be made in a rational way. Maybe weought to use the rational basis test to do it, and there would

                    criticisms, it seems to me, have not lookedat your record again. Because our legal tradition on the
                    firstamendment places a very high burden on prior restraints or attemptsto censure speech.Now, what

                    just mention a few. In the commercialspeech case, in Williamson Tobacco v. FTC, that is where you
                    heldthat the first amendment prohibits the FTC from restricting orgiving prior approval to some
                    advertising speech. Your opinion, itseems to me, made it clear that you would not tolerate even
                    theslightest degree of censorship. Again, I would say actions speaklouder than words, because you
                    were certainly protecting morethan political speech there, and you oppose censorship.By the way, my
                    records indicate that Justice Scalia and JudgeEdwards also joined you in that unanimous opinion; is
                    that right?</p>

                    dismisseda defamation suit against columnists Evans and Novak. Ofcourse, it would be interesting to
                    describe your reasoning in thatparticular case.You could just go on and on. Let me just bring out a
                    case ofCCNV v. Watt. You joined a dissent in the case concerning thedemonstrators who were camping
                    out in Lafayette Park. That is aninteresting case.Well, you could go on and on. I think the point I

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, I know there has been a great
                    deal of discussion alreadyabout your conduct in Watergate when you fired ArchibaldCox, the Watergate
                    special prosecutor. I want to put the facts inperspective, and then we would welcome an opportunity
                    for you torespond.In Nader v. Bork, District Court Judge Gesell ruled that youbroke the law when you
                    fired Mr. Cox. The decision was later vacatedon other grounds. The question is, what conclusion can
                    wedraw from the fact of the decision and the fact that it was latervacated? You argue that it now
                    has no legal effect at all. It is asthough the judge had never decided that you broke the law.
                    Butthe only judge who ever considered the question did conclude thatyou broke the law. You can take
                    the opinion out of the law, butyou cannot take it out of the history books, and you cannot eventake
                    it out of the law books.It seems to me the analogy is a bit like a baseball game. Let ussay a player
                    makes a serious error in the first inning and the officialscorer rules that he made the error; then
                    in the second inning,the rains come down and the game is called because of the weather.Under the
                    rules of baseball, the error does not count in theseason statistics for the player, but everybody in
                    the stadiumknows that he has made a serious error.In Watergate, Mr. Bork, everybody knows that a
                    federal judgeruled that you broke the law when you fired Archibald Cox duringthe very dramatic
                    period in our country's history.I would welcome whatever comment that you would like tomake.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, Senator, I am afraid that it is not true thateverybody knows that I
                    broke the law. The fact is at worst I actedbefore rescinding a regulation put out by the Attorney
                    General forthe Department. Even on that view of the case, Archibald Cox referredto that as, at most,
                    a technical defect.But, in addition to that, Senator, the district court relied uponcases that do
                    not apply; that is, cases in which a department headissued a regulation and then violated it. In
                    this case, the departmenthead issued a regulation, and it was revoked by the Presidentof the United
                    States when he issued the order. There is no case involvingthat situation, so I do not think in any
                    sense the verystrong terms, the "broke the law," applies to that case.</p>

                    the special prosecutor, so eventuallyit became moot. But I think when we had a number of
                    discussionson this issue in question, it was left somewhat up in the air. Ithink that it is
                    important that we have some perspective.You indicated that the only potential rationale for
                    believing thatyou broke the law was because of the technical aspects of the law;that the regulations
                    themselves were not repealed. Do you notthink a Supreme Court nominee must be scrupulous to obey
                    eventhe most technical aspects of the law, particularly where the stakesfor the country were so
                    incredibly high?</p>

                    constitutional basis for a number of landmarkdecisions by the Supreme Court upholding some of the
                    most fundamentalrights and liberties of the American people. In the course ofthese hearings, you
                    have expressed your strong disagreement withsuch decisions as the poll tax case, Harper v. Virginia
                    Board ofEducation; the one-man, one-vote, Reynolds v. Sims decision, thedecision invalidating
                    racially restrictive covenants; the decisionstriking down segregated schools here in the District of
                    Columbia;the important decision recognizing that American citizens have aright to privacy, free from
                    intrusion of government; and key decisionsprotecting the freedom of speech.Now, notwithstanding your
                    strong criticisms of these and othercases, you have asked us to accept your statements that you
                    wouldnot lightly or easily vote to overturn these precedents. But in anumber of past speeches while
                    you have been a judge, you havehad some less reassuring things to say about your philosophy andyour
                    respect for precedent.In 1982, you told the National Review, and I quote, "My own philosophyis
                    interpretivist, and I must say that this puts me in a distinctminority among law professors. By my
                    count, there were inrecent years perhaps 5 interpretivists on the faculty of the 10 bestknown law
                    schools, and now the President has put four of them oncourts of appeals. That is why faculty members
                    who do not likemuch else about Ronald Reagan regard him as a great reformer."Did you really believe
                    in 1982 that you were only one of five professorsin the ten best law schools that saw the light?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">We will include in the record the other talkwhere you did list the ones that
                    you were referring to.Let me just continue. Next, you told us inthese hearings that your views are
                    changing in a number of controversialareas, but you told the "District Lawyer" in 1985 when youwere
                    a judge, and I quote,It is always embarrassing to sit here and say, no, I have not changed
                    anything,because I suppose one should always claim growth. But the fact is, no, my viewshave
                    remained about what they were. After all, courts are not that mysterious, andif you deal with them
                    enough and teach their opinions enough, you are likely toknow a great deal. So when you become a
                    judge, I do not think your viewpoint islikely to change greatly.Then you told the Federalist Society
                    in 1987, and I quote,An originalist judge would have no problem whatever in overruling a
                    non-originalistprecedent because that precedent, by the very basis of his judicial philosophyhas no
                    legitimacy.Finally, Mr. Bork, there is an audio tape of remarks which youmade at Canisius College in
                    Buffalo on October 8, 1985. With theChairman's permission, I would like to have the committee hear
                    anexcerpt from the tape which contains your answer to a questionabout your views on your respect for
                    precedent. We have heard youtestify about your position on this issue in these hearings, and Ithink
                    it would be helpful to the committee to hear the actualmanner in which you commented on the issue in
                    1985.First, we will hear the question and then we will hear from Mr.Bork.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">If we could hear the question.[Audio tape played.]Question. If I can follow
                    that up. Now, the relationship between the judge, thetext, and precedent, what do you do about
                    precedent?"Mr. Bork. I don't think that in the field, of constitutional law, precedent is allthat
                    important. And I say that for two reasons. One is historical and traditional.The Court has never
                    thought constitutional precedent was all that important—thereason being that if you construe a
                    statute incorrectly, the Congress can pass a lawand correct you. If you construe the Constitution
                    incorrectly, Congress is helpless.Everybody is helpless. You're the final word. And if you become
                    convinced that aprior court has misread the Constitution, I think it's your duty to go back and
                    correctit. Moreover, you will from time to time get willful courts who take an area oflaw and create
                    precedents that have nothing to do with the name of the Constitution.And if a new court comes in and
                    says, "Well, I respect precedent," what youhave is a ratchet effect, with the Constitution getting
                    further and further and furtheraway from its original meaning, because some judges feel free to make
                    up newconstitutional law and other judges in the name of judicial restraint follow precedent.I don't
                    think precedent is all that important. I think the importance is whatthe framers were driving at,
                    and to go back to that.Judge Bork, in light of what we have justheard, how can anyone have
                    confidence that you will respect thedecisions of the Supreme Court with which you disagree?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NOW, in the Federalist Society speech, you have theoriginal notes there,
                    Senator. I do not know if you do, but the committeehas them. I had some typed remarks, not much but
                    a few,and somebody before me spoke and I scribbled in the margin aboutan originalist judge, et
                    cetera, need not worry or something aboutoverruling a non-originalist decision because a
                    non-originalist decisionhas no legitimacy. In the next paragraph, which was the typedpart of my
                    speech, I then gave an example of non-originalist decisionsthat should not be overruled.That was a
                    commerce clause decision, not in conformity with theoriginal intent of those who drafted the
                    commerce clause, but thatclause has been expanded so much it cannot be cut back and I saidthat in
                    the next paragraph, so I was certainly not saying you couldoverrule anything. Now, as to this tape
                    you just played, Senator,generally what I said there is correct and the reason for it is thisand it
                    is the reason that every judge has given.If there is an incorrect constitutional interpretation, the
                    legislaturecannot change it. The political forces of the nation are helplessunless they can amend
                    the Constitution. If there is an incorrectinterpretation of a statute, the legislature can correct
                    it. Thatis why it has always been true that the doctrine of stare decisis ora doctrine of precedent
                    has always applied more severely in statutoryfields than in the constitutional field.I learned that
                    in my first year in law school in a course taughtby Edward Levi, who had just written an article in
                    a book called"Introduction to Legal Reasoning" in which he points out that theCourt has always felt
                    that way. Now, that is a perfectly standardview.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">And the Court overruled it in Brown v. Board ofEducation. Now, this is a
                    standard view. For example, I will showyou Justice Brandeis. He is talking about stare decisis is
                    not a universal,inexorable command. In most matters, he says however, itis more important that the
                    applicable rule of law be settled thanthat it be settled right.Then he says, and this is from a
                    case, Burnett v. Colorado Oiland Gas:This is true, even where the error is a matter of serious
                    concern, provided correctioncan be had by legislation, but in cases involving the Federal
                    Constitution,where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court
                    hasoften overruled its earlier decision. The Court bows to the lessons of experience andthe force of
                    better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitfulin the physical
                    sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.Then, just one more quotation. Justice
                    William O. Douglas saidin a case:The judge remembers above all else that it is the Constitution
                    which he swore tosupport and defend, not the gloss which his predecessors may have put on it. So
                    hecomes to formulate his own views, rejecting some earlier ones as false and embracingothers. He
                    cannot do otherwise unless he lets men, long dead and unaware ofthe problems of the age in which he
                    lives, do his thinking for him.Now, those quotations are no stronger than what I said, but whatI
                    said, Senator, it is to be remembered, was in a give and take,question and answer session after a
                    speech. It was a quick answer.It was not a prepared statement. Now you have other speeches
                    andinterviews of mine, in the past, and I have stated the matter morefully.And in the same year as
                    that speech, in the "District Lawyer"interview, I said—it is the same year as the speech which
                    youplayed—there are some constitutional decisions around which somany other institutions and people
                    have built, that they havebecome a part of the structure of the Nation. They ought not to
                    beoverturned, even if thought to be wrong.The example I usually give, because I think it is a
                    non-controversial,is the broad interpretation of the commerce power by thecourts. So many statutes,
                    regulations, governmental institutions,private expectations and so forth, have been built up around
                    thatbroad interpretation of the commerce clause that it would too late,even if a justice or a judge
                    became certain that broad interpretationis wrong, as a matter of original intent, it is too late to
                    overturnit and tear it up.I said the same thing in the "Federal Society" speech to whichyou have
                    referred so that aside from a quick answer at a collegeone night after a speech, I have been fully
                    consistent, in thesehearings, with what I have said before and I have told you thesame thing about
                    the commerce clause, the legal tender cases, theequal protection clause, in the first amendment and
                    so forth, that Ihave told you about that precedent.</p>

                    Lawyer" article about the subject of prudentialrestraint, where people have relied on precedents.
                    Youwere asked whether "your view would be that a justice is entitled,as part of his
                    responsibilities, to re-examine a constitutional questionde novo?"Your answer was "I think that is
                    true of a justiceand true of a lower court judge unless he is bound by SupremeCourt precedent. After
                    all, there are a lot of considerations that gointo it. But at bottom, a judge's basic obligation or
                    basic duty is tothe Constitution, not simply to precedent."Now, in the course of these hearings, on
                    Tuesday, in evaluatingprecedent—included that in the record—you pointed out that weshould make sure
                    the decision was incorrectly decided and then determinewhether governmental and private institutions
                    havegrown up around that prior decision.In the Canisius College speech, you made the unqualified
                    statement,I don't think that in the field of constitutional law, precedent is all that importantand
                    if you become convinced that a prior court has mis-read the Constitution, Ithink it's your duty to
                    go back and correct it. I don't think a precedent is all thatimportant.Those statements speak for
                    themselves. Your own words caststrong doubt upon your adherence to precedent that you think iswrong.

                    professor,who has been dealing with these issues for a long period oftime, that this is just an
                    off-handed comment about legal theorem.You have been thinking about it. You have worked at it. It
                    isyour life. You made the statements and we have read a series ofstatements, rather than just this
                    one, and this body has had anopportunity to listen to your voice and how you characterize that.
                    Itseems to me that your series of statements make an extremelyconvincing case as to what your real
                    beliefs are with regard toprecedent, and that is going to have to stand.We have your other testimony
                    and people are going to have toevaluate that against what you have said as a judge. A great deal,in
                    the course of these hearings, has been made—let's not go backover the old years; let's go and
                    consider what he has said as ajudge.We have used these examples, a series of statements that
                    allreinforce themselves.The fact remains, you were sitting as a federal judge at this verytime of
                    the Canisius remarks. I think that federal judges are expectedto understand, or be able to give a
                    pretty good definition, ofhow they are going to respond to precedent.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">The only aspect that I addressed in that question,Senator, the only aspect
                    that I addressed was the distinction betweenthe theory of precedent or stare decisis in a
                    constitutionalcontext and a statutory context. That is the only time you can say Idid not go on to
                    say something more. In the Federalist Societyspeech, which you quoted, I did, in the next paragraph,
                    say ofcourse, there are some decisions that are so rooted you cannot turnthem over.In "The District
                    Lawyer"—in which I still have not found what Isaid—but you quoted me as saying at bottom, the
                    judge's obligationis to the Constitution, which is, of course, true. But right beforethat, I said a
                    lot of considerations go into whether to overturn ornot, which is what I have said here. So with a
                    single exception, Ithink, of one after-speech question and answer session, I have consistentlysaid
                    what I have said here.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I think the record will speak for itself. Ihave no further questions
                    of the nominee. I would like to just usethe remaining 2 or 3 minutes for a comment. I think Mr. Bork
                    hasclaimed that he is only applying neutral principles, but there issomething wrong with neutral
                    principles if the result is that Con668gress and the courts must be neutral in the face of
                    discriminationbecause of race, they must be neutral in the face of discriminationagainst women and
                    in the face of gross invasions by the Governmentof individual citizen's rights to privacy.Above all,
                    a Supreme Court Justice must be fair, but in life-timeof writings on the public record, Mr. Bork has
                    shown his biasagainst women and minorities and in favor of big business andPresidential power.It is
                    small comfort to minorities to know thatsome years after the Civil Rights Act was passed over his
                    opposition,Mr. Bork changed his mind and said that it had worked allright. But if you had had your
                    way, Mr. Bork, no one would everhave known how the Civil Rights Act would work.Mr. Bork is against
                    the one man, one vote decision of the SupremeCourt, which says that everyone's vote should count
                    equallyand the same. He would allow majorities to write laws that givegreater weight to some
                    people's vote than others and that is thevery opposite of democracy. Mr. Bork asks us to judge him
                    on hisrecord, as a judge, but in his own speeches, as a judge, he hasshown little respect for past
                    decisions of the Supreme Court.Again and again on the public record, he has suggested that he
                    isprepared to roll back the clock, return to more troubled times,uproot decades of settled law in
                    order to write his own ideologyinto law. And in these hearings this week, he has asked us to
                    believethat he can make a U-turn in these areas of fundamental importance.The question all of us are
                    asking is who is the realRobert Bork and what risks are we taking for the future if he becomesa
                    Justice of the Supreme Court with the last word about justicein America.The White House strategy, in
                    these proceedings, has been clear.Mr. Bork's balloon was losing altitude in the Senate, and he
                    hasbeen rapidly jettisoning the baggage of a lifetime in opposition toindividual liberty and equal
                    justice. President Reagan has failed toachieve his ideological agenda in Congress and is not
                    entitled toachieve it by an ideological nomination to the Supreme Court thatcould reverse the
                    progress of the past and tilt the country farbeyond the end of his term.America is ready to move
                    forward with the Supreme Court, notbackward. But Mr. Bork is out of step with the Congress, out
                    ofstep with the country, out of step with the Constitution and manyof the most fundamental issues
                    facing America. Mr. Bork is a walkingconstitutional amendment and he should not be confirmed bythe
                    Senate.</p>

                    evidence and what you say would behighly amusing. I have not asked that either the Congress nor
                    thecourts be neutral in the face of racial discrimination. I have upheldthe laws that outlaw racial
                    discrimination. I have consistently supportedBrown v. Board of Education in my writings long ago.
                    Ihave never written a word hostile to women.I have never written a word hostile to privacy. I have
                    complainedabout the reasoning of one Supreme Court case. I have never writtena word or made a
                    decision from which you can infer that I ampro-big business at the expense of other people. And as
                    far as Presidentialpower is concerned, I have very rarely dealt with that, butwhen I have, it is on
                    constitutional principles and upon occasion, asin the pocket veto matter, you will find me squarely
                    opposing Presidentialpower.I have no ideological agenda and if I did, it would not do me anygood
                    because nobody else on the Court has an ideological agendaand I do not intend, if confirmed, to be
                    the only person up there,running around with a political agenda. In fact, nothing in myrecord
                    suggests I have a political or ideological agenda.</p>

                    did take an oath and you take thatoath very seriously and you have a belief in a higher being
                    andthat is what makes the oath worth taking. That is how that works.That ain't corny. That is the
                    way that is.But again, back to writings. It was curious to me and it has beenlike a law school
                    seminar in some situations to hear you and myfine friend from Pennsylvania discussing certain areas
                    of the lawin a highly honed way. For me to listen to this is educational andvery fascinating how you
                    get into it and both can bat it around—and others. And Senator Metzenbaum with his antitrust.
                    Havingnever written a book—this fellow said he had written in the areaof probate—he wrote a very
                    provocative book called "The Role ofthe Decedent in Estate Planning." I could have written a book
                    likethat and I thought that that is the only title I could have probablygotten away with.But, I had
                    an awful lot of fun practicing law in a profession thatI dearly loved and I wrote some awfully
                    stupid letters. People stillbring them to my attention. I tried some really goofy cases,
                    losers,total losers. In pro bono—we really did not get going on pro bonountil I was about 3 or 4
                    years into the practice, about 1963. Somebodysaid, you know, we ought to do some pro bono. We said,
                    wellwe will so the Park County Bar Association said we will do, youknow, blank hours a month, each
                    of us and check the book.I do not know how many lawyers did it that way. We did. Wethought we were
                    pro bono automatically. We were charging 10bucks an hour for our work. So, pro bono was not what it
                    is now.That again is kind of what this whole thing is about. We arejudging you on the basis of
                    September 18th, 1987, when they forgeteverything that was swirling around in 1964 and 1971 and
                    1980,whenever. That's, I think, total distortion.Back to that extraordinary case, the "illegal"
                    case, that you didsomething illegal. Well, I tell you, I used to use Black's law dictionaryonly when
                    I was in extremity. The word "vacate" in Black'slaw dictionary says "To amend, to set aside, to
                    cancel, or rescind;to render an act void; to vacate an entry of record or judgment." Itis not
                    synonymous with "suspend," which means to stay enforcementof judgment or decree—to put an end to.I
                    hope we can put an end to what must be another goofy casewhere the party that won didn't want to go
                    any further with it.Now, you don't have to be a real wizard to know that must be areal turkey. And
                    it was vacated. And that ought to be the end ofthat, surely.So I guess what we, who support your
                    nomination—I guess wekind of come out and say, ah, that's crazy, how can that be? But,obviously,
                    that isn't enough, because those on the other side sayhighly dramatic things: you have shocked my
                    senses, you have leftme limp, I cannot believe what I have read, you have stunned me.Well, I tell
                    you, why wouldn't someone in America be alarmed tosee the distortion of your record. How would
                    anyone not, any sensibleAmerican not be disturbed if they read your record? The word"poll tax" is
                    immediately equated with racism. I think we all oughtto get awfully tired of that; that case had
                    nothing to do withracism, nothing. The words "poll tax" have a marvelous connotation—no, a hideous
                    connotation of racism. And you would havetrashed it in a minute, would you have not, if it had
                    anything to dowith racism?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Of course, the basis of my discussion of that casewas that it had nothing to
                    do with racism and therefore it was alittle hard to follow some of the reasoning. I should say—I've
                    justbeen handed the opinion in that case, Senator, and Justice HugoBlack dissented from that ruling
                    that the poll tax was automaticallyunconstitutional, even when there was no racism. And in his
                    dissent,he said:"It should be pointed out at once that the Court's decision is to no extent based
                    ona finding that the Virginia law, as written or as applied, is being used as a device ora mechanism
                    to deny Negro citizens of Virginia the right to vote on account of theircolor. Apparently the Court
                    agrees with the district court below, and with my brothersHarlan and Stewart, that this record would
                    not support any finding that theVirginia poll tax law the Court invalidates has any such effect.That
                    is, any such discriminatory effect. Hugo Black said thatvery plainly, and, indeed, the Court did not
                    claim that there wasany racial animus in that poll tax.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">All right, now, several Senators have gonethrough the list of your actions
                    and views and cases and amicusbriefs, and the full-page newspaper ads have continued in harshand
                    hysterical tones, and repeated and supplemented your,"record", which is really so grossly distorted,
                    from prior writingsand speeches. And, you know, when I ask who these groups are, Inever really can
                    find out; it's really getting to be a phantom kindof a networking operation now—they are running out
                    of gas, ormoney, and nobody really takes any responsibility. I wasn't goingto use the word
                    "credit"—that would be a disservice.But other items in these listings and in these advertisings
                    arenot only unfair, in my mind—and in some cases outrageous; theyare dishonest—I will use that
                    term—and they are lies—I will evenuse that term, because that's more perfunctory and more real,
                    andone that I'd love to stick with: lies. And those are words thatpeople know, words like
                    "lie."Going over this list that we have heard this morning—and I'vehad my list over the last 3
                    days—on what you have done on thecourt, which are not anything more than things of the record,which
                    are precise and irrefutable; they are in the statutes, in thelaw books. So when we get to what is
                    the point, what kind of a Justicewill this man be as a Supreme Court judge, it is quite helpfulto
                    see what he was as an appellate judge. And I am not going to gothrough the cases that have already
                    been reported about femaleForeign Service officers entitled to the same pay as similarly
                    employedmale officers—you did that; holding that intentional sex discriminationcan be inferred
                    solely on statistical evidence—a marvelouspro-civil rights decision; female stewardesses may not
                    bepaid less than male pursers with similar jobs; two cases on title 7,which were liberally
                    construed, which in effect kept the courthousedoor open for aggrieved people who claimed employment
                    discrimination—that hasn't been quoted before, and that's Nordell v. Hecklerand Tyrell v. U.S.
                    Postal Service—you kept the door open, otherpeople were trying to shut it on blacks and others; the
                    senior militaryofficers case and the promotion decision on the black officer—you did that, you
                    opened that door for him; the South Carolinavote where there was an at-large election without first
                    proving thatthe change would have no discriminatory effect against blacks—you did that, you opened
                    that door, that isn't something you talkabout on a podium or sing about—you did it. That's not the
                    view ofa judge who is hostile to women and minorities; it sounds to melike a very compassionate
                    man.I hope the people of America are seeing that in you, a judge whohas expanded civil rights during
                    every bit of his writings and decisionsinstead of pinching it down and shutting it off. The
                    earlierRobert Bork, you know, who wrote all those provocative law reviewarticles—well, that's you,
                    too. Theory, I read that yesterday whatyou said about as you opened and prefaced those remarks in
                    thatlaw review article, and how you ended it.What was interesting to me was that when you were
                    SolicitorGeneral you filed several briefs supporting the rights of minoritiesand rights of women
                    when you didn't even have to, didn't you?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I'm sure that's true. But, in any event, it wasessential—and you did that.
                    Then you represented the position ofunions—you went through those other cases. And no one has
                    reallypresented any honest evidence of you doing these heinous things inthis country, and that
                    really—well, that galls me—I'm not going toask you what it does with you. Because I believe in
                    fairness. Youknow, you can play this game of politics—and I love it, I can bataround in it, chew up
                    in it, snarl, and then go off and have a lightglass of ale with some guys who I vote with 5 percent
                    of the time—but that's fun for me, because that's the way I practiced law.So to hear these things
                    said about you—the best and most attractivephrase, it just seems wierd, absolutely wierd, to hear
                    thatwhen the cases are there. I think it shows how much we are talkingpast each other with regard to
                    you. I hope we are somewherelistening in this process and that our colleagues on the floor will
                    belistening, because it would be a great disservice to talk past eachother as regards you. And if
                    it's not being heard, that would beindeed too bad. And if that happens and goes on, they will
                    notknow about you.I was interested again in that issue of precedent and overrulingand so on. I don't
                    know how you can get any more clear thanthat—I really don't—because in the same article that is
                    being usedto drum you about the head and shoulders, this "District Lawyer"article—you said it all in
                    there, that, you know, if things had beenbuilt up, regulations and governmental institutions and
                    private expectationshad been built up around that, it's too late, even if a justiceor judge became
                    certain that broad interpretation is wrong inthe matter of original intent, to tear it up and
                    overturn it. That'swhat you said. And then at the end of that article you said "If theJustices have
                    become convinced that a decision cannot be squaredwith the Constitution, they ought to consider
                    overruling it. But theCourt should be careful"—these are your words—"If a particulardecision has
                    become the basis for a large array of social and economicinstitutions, overruling it could be
                    disastrous." You saidthat, didn't you?</p>

                    because of his consistent opposition towomen's rights, but, more importantly, because he has
                    demonstrated that his legalopinions on women's issues are based on an apparent personal philosophy
                    and noton the facts and laws and cases before him. Thus he lacks the fairness and the
                    impartialityrequisite for appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.That's about Justice

                <p class="short_transcript">Heh, heh, heh. [Laughter.]That the draft was a good example of a case where
                    distinctionsbased on race were improper, but distinctions based on genderwere not improper. Now, I
                    should point out to you—I know this ishideous—that a majority of the Senators agreed with the
                    finding ofthe Supreme Court on that, and your example, that gender-baseddistinctions are acceptable
                    in certain rare circumstances. On June10, 1980, the U.S. Senate itself voted to exclude women from
                    PresidentCarter's draft plan by a vote of 51 to 40. A number of peopleon this panel participated in
                    that vote, six of us sitting right here,three Republicans, three Democrats, to exclude women from
                    thedraft.Now, I just want to make a point that Congress was quite willingto make a gender-based
                    distinction in this case, present criticismsand dire comments notwithstanding. I think that's kind
                    of importantto kind of touch on occasionally. That's real life.The first amendment, that is a
                    troubling thing. I cannot believethat anyone is going to try to blast you away on the first
                    amendment.I do not know of anybody that has done more.There should not be a person in this country
                    to believe that youwould not broaden it. You have said you would, and, as I say, yourfavorite guy
                    that was doing the posters over there, that you allowedhim to do that, has done some ever-new ones
                    now. I want toget over and see them, and they are on the wall.And you gave him all the ability to do
                    that, to raise hell aboutthis President, your President, his President, and he is doing itagain. It
                    is opinion, it is his expression, and, that is real life.You did that, didn't you, in that case?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I have read that case, and it is fascinating, andof course several have read
                    about the fact that you must be willingto bear criticism, disparagement, and even wounding
                    assessments.We all have been through that one. We have been there.But I loved what you went on to
                    say. You said:Perhaps it would be better if disputation were conducted in measured phrases,and
                    calibrated assessments, and with strict avoidance of the ad hominem, better,that is, if the opinion
                    and editorial pages of the public press were modeled on TheFederalist Papers.But that is not the
                    world in which we live, ever have lived, or ever likely to know,and the law of the first amendment
                    must not try to make public disputes safe andcomfortable for all the participants. That would only
                    stifle the debate.In our world, the kind of commentary that the columnists have engaged in here
                    isthe coin in which the controversialists are commonly paid.I like that. That is pretty gutsy,
                    strong, fair, firm, protective ofthe first amendment, and people.Well, I am going to conclude here,
                    but I hope everyone sees theessence of what is happening here, the essence of this cause
                    againstJudge Bork.I do not want anybody to miss this.The opponents of Robert Bork are the opponents
                    of any kind ofchange in the Supreme Court in my view. They really wanted tohalt Sandra Day O'Connor.
                    They really did. But they could notreally challenge that remarkable, steady, personable lady.
                    Theyjust could not do anything with her.And she is a tremendous lady, and jurist. They really wanted
                    totoss Rehnquist off the side of the ship. But as they frothed at themouth there, they finally
                    sobered up and realized he was alreadyon the Court. That was a dazzling thing for them to decide,
                    thatfinally, they thought, well, we will kick him off as Chief Justice buthe is still going to be
                    there, and then they are going to bring insomebody else.That brought a note of sobriety to their
                    cause. He was already onthe Court. And with Scalia, they saw another bright, dedicated,
                    articulatespirited man, and they had already spurted all the venomout of their glands with Rehnquist
                    when he came along, and theywere then exhausted from the attempt to land the fatal strike
                    onRehnquist and they slipped back to their lair, or den, whicheveryou wish</p>

                    said "Get Bork. He's next. Can't possibly misshim on the next selection. That's him."And they put
                    their researchers and their minions to work, andthey readied their fund-raising apparatus, and they
                    cranked up thenetworking, and hours and days of work in a non-unanimous decisionventure. Every
                    utterance. I mean, you know, when you aredragging stuff out of a question and answer session at a
                    school in1985, and then hearing it in—you know—that took a lot of work. Alot of people have done a
                    lot of work.</p>

                    important.I want the record to show that I went to Judge Bork yesterday,and gave him a full
                    transcript, told him that that tape had beensent, unsolicited, to several people, apparently. I know
                    I was sent atape. And I did not want him to be caught unaware by anything. Ihad the tape
                    transcribed, I gave it to him, told him I would not askhim any questions about that tape, and for a
                    full day, to give him afull opportunity to look at it, and I am sure the tape was sent toother
                    people by a student up there, as I recall.I may be mistaken. So I just do not want you to think that

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, I will conclude in 2 minutes,and I promise that, from these
                    notes that were thoughtfully preparedby me, because I am trying to figure where it all started.And
                    as I say, it started when Scalia was approved in the mostremarkable fashion. That was a remarkable
                    confirmation hearing.So then they set up their early-warning system: if Robert Bork isnominated it
                    will be destructive, it will be contentious. And thenthey said this to the American people, after
                    Judge Lewis Powellannounced his retirement.They said if Robert Bork is nominated it will be
                    destructive, contentious,quote, "time-consuming"—whatever that connotation—weknow what that means in
                    the Senate. It will be a struggle. It willbe a watershed, shifting the balance, and, there was a
                    kind of awarning to our President that he should not do this.When the President nominated you they
                    detonated the package,they were ready to do that, and they did it in a way I think wherethe shards
                    and the chunks from the explosion, you know, were destinedto be a little hurtful and painful, and
                    injure.Because they really do not care about that. The personal anguishof that to you is not
                    important to those kind, and yet they will tellyou they represent the oppressed and the
                    disenfranchised, and thepowerless, and those who need care. But give them another humanbeing to gnaw
                    on and they will do it in a rather extraordinarilytough, mean, nasty fashion.So what that they
                    maligned your character, which is all we havein life. Your life style. Why wouldn't any thoughtful
                    American bestunned, and deeply concerned in the full burst of all that, as theyfired that around the
                    United States? They were saying you were aracist, a sexist, one who would deny women their rights. A
                    segregationist.A peeper at the keyhole. An invader of privacy. Insensitiveto homosexuals, and in
                    favor of mandatory sterilization of yourfellow man and woman.Who wouldn't be frightened by that, or
                    deeply appalled and concerned?Well, I think the American people are terribly fair. They hear,and
                    they know, and you have been right there for four days, andthe interested ones have been observing
                    the process, and they haveto see you and know your persona as a most extraordinary man,with a
                    dazzling record. A creative, thoughtful man with an agile,adroit and facile mind.And the American
                    people, and our colleagues would, in my mind,Mr. Chairman, be ill-served, and very certainly cruelly
                    shortchangedif you are to be rejected in these proceedings. Thank you.</p>

                    talking about the American Cyanamidcase, you said "They offered a choice to the women. Some ofthem I
                    guess did not want to have children".Apparently that testimony was heard by one of the women,
                    becausea telegram has just been received by the Chairman andmyself which reads as follows:I cannot
                    believe that Judge Bork thinks we were glad to have the choice of gettingsterilized or getting
                    fired. Only a judge who knows nothing about women whoneed to work could say that. I was only 26
                    years old, but I had to work, so I had nochoice. It is incredible that a judge who is supposed to be
                    fair can support a companythat does not follow OSHA rules. This was the most awful thing that
                    happenedto me. I still believe it's against the law, whatever Bork says. Betty Riggs,

                    awrenching decision for us, but the entire panel agreed on—theOSHA review commission agreed with us,
                    agreed that it was not aviolation of the hazardous conditions provision of the statute.The entire

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, I thank you.Judge Bork, I am sorry I have not been able to be
                    present tohear the questions and the answers. I have watched whenever Icould, but have been busy on
                    the Senate floor, and I do have thetapes of the hearings thus far, and Mr. Chairman, I hope
                    throughthe weekend to be able to watch the tapes and catchup with thecommittee in its work.Judge
                    Bork, I have stated before, and I will state today, that Iam undecided as to how I will vote on your
                    nomination.There are those who may wish to categorize my vote, or pigeonholeit, or put it in
                    whatever niche they wish, but I do not knowhow I would vote if I had to cast a vote today.I have
                    been in the legislative branch of our government now for42 years, 35 years on Capitol Hill, 29 of
                    which years have been inthe Senate.I have naturally, in that course of time, acquired a deep sense
                    ofdedication to the legislative branch, and so the few questions that Iwill ask will pertain to the
                    subject of congressional standing.I very much support the constitutional principle of separation
                    ofpowers, very much support the constitutional principle of checksand balances, and particularly on
                    these two bases, I have a greatconcern with respect to some of the developments that have
                    occurredwithin the last few years.And so I am going to ask just a question or two, or three. I
                    understandthat Senator Kennedy has already gotten into this area ofquestions.But let me say that I
                    would like to follow up on that discussion,and ask you whether the institutions of the House and
                    Senate canbring a case in federal court, to determine what I conceive to betheir constitutional
                    rights with respect to the executive branch, letus say.You spoke about this in the context of the
                    case of Barnes v.Kline, in which the President had vetoed a bill, and the Senatesued to have a court
                    declare that the President's pocket veto wasinvalid under the circumstances, and that the bill had
                    thereforebecome the law.The majority in your court found in favor of the Senate, but Ibelieve you
                    wrote a dissenting opinion on the grounds that theSenate did not have such standing to bring such a
                    case.I believe you have said in the course of that opinion, that, quote,"We ought to renounce
                    outright the whole notion of congressionalstanding".Have I correctly quoted you, Judge Bork.</p>

                    the majority didinvoke equitable discretion and refused to hear the case. That wasa case in which
                    Congressman Vander Jagt sued to get proportionalrepresentation on House committees. No, that is

                <p class="short_transcript">They can be invalid. That is it. When I was in theDepartment of Justice as
                    Solicitor General, Senator Kennedybrought a suit about a pocket veto saying it was not a valid
                    pocketveto. The court I now sit on held that it was not a valid pocketveto. I did not ask the
                    Supreme Court to review that because Ithought it was an invalid pocket veto.When the subject came up
                    again in the Ford administration, Itold Attorney General Levi that I would not—it was not a
                    pocketveto—that I would not argue the case and would not appear on thebrief because I thought it was
                    an invalid pocket veto. I then preparedan extensive memorandum, which this committee has,saying that
                    when Congress leaves an officer or somebody behind toreceive a return veto, even though they are in
                    adjournment, youmust give a return veto and not a pocket veto.President Ford was persuaded to say
                    that for the remainder ofhis administration, he would not use the pocket veto if there wassomebody
                    here to receive a return veto. That was a clear case inwhich I advised the executive that he did not
                    have a constitutionalpower the executive wanted, but that Congress could behave in thisway.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, it is simply this, Senator. I am not hostile tocongressional standing
                    any more than I am to Presidential standingor judicial standing. The theory upon which that
                    case—thestanding was rested there was that the President was not carryingout a law and that
                    interfered with congressional powers and therefore,they could sue. But, if that is true, I do not
                    see why, if Congressoverrides a Presidential veto and he says, that is unconstitutional,I do not see
                    why the President cannot sue Congress.In fact, in the Chadha case, which struck down the
                    legislativeveto in the Supreme Court—the President did not have to wait forthat case if this
                    governmental standing power is correct. The Presidentcould have sued long ago to strike down the
                    legislative veto.And it is not just Presidential standing. It is judicial standing. If ajudge feels
                    that an act of Congress unconstitutionally interfereswith his functions, he could sue Congress.And,
                    in fact, it even got worse than that because in the SeventhCircuit Court of Appeals, when they
                    reversed two district courtjudges, and the district court judges appealed to the SupremeCourt, not
                    just the parties, the judges appealed on the grounds thattheir offices had been interfered with. So
                    I am afraid what happens,if we allow standing to expand like that, is the courts willbecome the most
                    important branch of government and will umpiredisputes everywhere between themselves and the other
                    branchesand between the other two branches.Now, in a case like the kind you are talking about, a
                    privateparty can usually sue. That is, if Congress passes a statute, and thePresident fails to carry
                    it out, such as an appropriation or somethingof that sort, usually a private party can say, wait a
                    minute, Ishould have gotten that money but the President did not behavecorrectly, and he has
                    standing. That does not put the courts intothe middle of running the other two branches.There is no
                    preference for the executive branch, in my view, inthis matter. It is simply a matter of not
                    bringing all governmentalissues into the courts right away as everybody sues everybody elsebetween
                    the branches.</p>

                <strong>Robert C. Byrd</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">This still leaves me troubled, though, Judge Bork.If you take the position
                    that "we ought to renounce, outright, thewhole notion of congressional standing." Let us confine
                    this to thepoint that was being—the thrust of your statement, that point.Notwithstanding the fact
                    that you say that this is not only withcongressional standing, but also with the executive and the
                    judicialstanding.It seems to me that to say that if this is recognized in one case, ifstanding is
                    given, let's say, to Congress, then we open the door forall sorts of cross-currents of suits on the
                    part of the executive, onthe part of the Congress and on the part of the judiciary and all ofthat.
                    It seems to me, most respectfully, that is carrying the matterto an absurd conclusion. You would use
                    the terms reductio ad absurdum.After all, this is the 199th year of the executive and the
                    congressionaland the judicial branches. Next year will be the 200th year,1789 will not be the 200th
                    year, that will be the 201st year. That isthe first year in the third century. Well, in all of these
                    centuries, Ido not think this matter has been decided and I think you pointedthat out. But it would
                    seem to me that if there has been no conclusionby the Supreme Court, that Congress would have
                    standing, orthat either of the other branches would have standing.There has been no decision by the
                    Court or that they would nothave standing. It seems to me that we would have already seenthis
                    enaction, one going at the other and certainly, there wouldhave been more opportunities than we have
                    seen, which have beenof rather recent vintage, in which the Court would have had theopportunity to
                    say one way or the other on this question. But, let'smove on from that just a moment.You also
                    mentioned private parties. Suppose there is no privateparty that can show injury and let's take, for
                    example, I do notknow—perhaps we should not comment on the matter that isbefore the Senate right now
                    in which the Nunn-Levin Amendmentwas voted on, which goes to the interpretation of the ABM Treatyand
                    whether or not it should be the traditional interpretation ofthe broad. You may or may not have an
                    opportunity to study thatcase and perhaps make a decision, render one on it.But, let's put it in
                    this context. Let's say that the Senate approvesthe ratification of a treaty that provides certain
                    rights andobligations for our government in its embassy abroad and the foreigncountry's embassy in
                    our country. And let's say that underthe interpretation of that treaty, based on the counsel and
                    adviceand testimony of the State Department and the other executivewitnesses before the appropriate
                    committee, certain kinds of intelligencegathering could be engaged in, within the context of
                    thattreaty. And so the Senate, by two-thirds vote, approves the ratificationof the treaty.Now later,
                    the President decides to reinterpret that treaty, let'ssay. He says, no, we cannot do this. We will
                    not be able to do thisintelligence gathering. Say it is a subsequent President and he interpretsit
                    differently. And so, the Senate, having been the partyunder the Constitution which had the role of
                    approving the ratifi683cation of the treaty—the Senate does not ratify treaties. TheSenate may
                    approve the ratification of the treaties. The Presidentratifies treaties, after the Senate gives its
                    approval.But, let's say that the Senate just does not take umbrage, butthat some vital matter to the
                    security interests of this country,hangs on the action of the President in having reinterpreted
                    thattreaty. Now, why should not the Senate and the House, for thatmatter—the House does not have a
                    role in approving the ratificationof treaties, but the House has a role in appropriating themonies
                    to carry out the objectives of the treaty.Let's say the Congress or the Senate—let's narrow it to
                    theSenate—the Senate wants to bring this case. There is no injuredparty. I, as a Senator from West
                    Virginia, cannot say I have beenpersonally injured and so I cannot fulfill that requirement ofinjury
                    in fact, but are you, as the judge on the Supreme Court oron the circuit court in which this might
                    be brought, going to denythe United States Senate standing to challenge the President'saction in
                    reinterpreting that treaty?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, the judiciary can throw this case outor that case out on its
                    merits. But if this party, the third branch—the Senate—cannot even get inside the door, who is going
                    to settlethis case. And let's say the security interests of this country areinvolved. You are saying
                    to me, as you said at the time I referredto in using this quotation, you ain't never going to get in
                    this court.Let's take the Panama Canal treaty, for example. I was the majorityleader at the time of
                    that—they are treaties, not treaty, butlet's, for the sake of argument, refer to it as the Panama
                    Canaltreaty—was approved by the Senate. The only way we could getthat treaty approved was to have an
                    amendment, actually twoamendments, one giving the clear rights to the United States to interveneat
                    any time to keep that Canal open, after the year 2000,and the other was that the United States would
                    go to the head ofthe line in the event of war.Now, let's say—Mr. Reagan was very much opposed to
                    thosetreaties, but we note that he has not done anything about negatingthem since he has been
                    President. He has lived up to them. Butlet's say that he or a future President would say, I am not
                    going tolive up to that and we get into a war and he says no, personally Ihave never believed in it
                    and I think I am justified in nullifyingthose treaties and I am not going to insist that our ships
                    go to thehead of the line.Well, now that was one of the few bases on which some Senators,who sit at
                    this table, voted to approve the ratification of thattreaty. That was not just a majority. As I have
                    understood youheretofore, you have said that in cases between certain litigants,that the majority
                    will, or the legislature in that instance, shouldprevail. Here, we have not only the majority will,
                    but the supermajority,which was required under the Constitution.So, you have a super-majority in the
                    Senate that approved theratification of that treaty on the understanding that the
                    administration—everybody interpreted it the same way and the otherparty interpreted the treaty in
                    the same light and here we are nowwith a subsequent President who says, I am not going to
                    observethat treaty. It is null and void as far as I am concerned. Now, let'ssay that security
                    interests of the United States are very much injeopardy there and the lives of men and women are in
                    danger.By virtue of the reinterpretation of that subsequent executive,who is going to be able to
                    decide. As I said the other day, whowould decide when doctors disagree? You have the
                    executivebranch, you have the legislative branch, they are in disagreementhere. You had a
                    super-majority in the legislative branch that saidthat it would be this way. Now, we have got to go
                    to some umpireor referee to determine this in the interests of the United States.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I certainly see the concerns you have, Senator, andI think they are
                    well-founded concerns. The difficulty I have—it isnot a difficulty, I just observe that it has never
                    proved to be necessaryto go to a court for a reason like that in our history so far.Now, Justice
                    Powell did suggest—although he was not very fond ofcongressional standing—that if there was an
                    absolute impasse betweenthe President and the Congress, he would allow congressionalstanding. I do
                    not know. I have never faced a case like that. Butthe difficulty is, additionally, that quite aside
                    from any views onstanding, in the Goldwater v. Carter case, four of the justices—thatis, Justice
                    Rehnquist, Chief Justice Burger, Justice Stewart andJustice Stevens, would have applied the
                    political question doctrineand made the entire dispute, over the termination of the
                    treaty,non-justiciable. If they are right, there are other doctrines thatstand in the way and I have
                    not decided those questions. I have noidea. But it may be that the courts are going to have
                    difficulty withsuits about that kind of thing, quite aside from any views of mine.But I would just
                    simply observe that for 200 years, we have neverfound it necessary to have a court decide who is
                    right about atreaty or something of that sort, between the President and theCongress. Maybe there
                    will come a terrible emergency some dayand I do not know what the courts will do upon that occasion.
                    Butcertainly, Senator, I would suggest it should not be a routinematter that the Congress and the
                    President and the judges and thevarious departments all sue each other in order to find out
                    whereeverybody stands.I am not trying to offer you any kind of alliation of my views. Ihave just
                    never faced a case where there was a great emergencyand the Congress and the President were at an
                    impasse. I have justnever seen such a case. But if I faced one, I do not know what Iwould do.But I
                    certainly, as I said, do not want that to be a routine subjectof court litigation because the courts
                    will sit just to decide what areessentially political questions all of the time.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, we are living in a fast-moving age and whowould have known when I
                    graduated from high school that wewould have computers or that we would be talking about laserbeams
                    of SDI or any of these things. And the common law wasmade of precedent. There are Senate precedents.
                    There comes atime when we set a precedent. We would not have precedents ifthey had not been new in
                    the beginning.So there may be some unforeseen need and I believe that thepossibility of that need
                    arising is probably greater than it was 50years ago or 100 years ago. And so I think, as Mr. Justice
                    Powellstated in the case to which you referred, by defining the respectiveroles of the two branches
                    in the enactment process, this court willhelp to preserve, not defeat, the separation of power.It
                    seems to me that it would become necessary for the court atsome point in time to give the Congress
                    the standing because otherwisethat case is never going to be decided by anybody and whatyou are
                    saying—I say most respectfully—you are saying, let theCongress and the executive engage in guerilla
                    warfare. Let themengage in guerilla warfare.If the President wants to take such and such an action,
                    let theCongress reject his next nominee to the Supreme Court or cut offthe money. Congress controls
                    the purse. And confrontation is what,I think, would ensue. It seems to me that could greatly damage
                    thecountry.</p>

                    acertain motion. But at some point the Senate will have to decidethat and it thereby will set a
                    precedent, or it may overrule someprevious precedent.I think I hear you saying—and I am not
                    attempting to put wordsin your mouth, you control that side of the table—but it seems tome, I would
                    say, well, I do not know how the Senate would comedown in that hypothetical set of circumstances,

                    the Senate speak.In the Senate, if someone raises a constitutional question, theChair does not rule.
                    The Chair submits that question to the Senate,a constitutional question. So we may have to decide a
                    constitutionalquestion in the future that we have not decided yet. And today Imight maintain a
                    certain position but it would be a little hard forme to say never.I am hoping I am hearing you say

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, let me say this. In the routine kind of casein which the President
                    and the legislative branch get into a squabbleover whether an appropriations bill is being properly
                    carriedout, I think there should not be congressional standing or Presidentialstanding or judicial
                    standing in that kind of a case and what Iam really trying to protect—this is an aspect of my
                    general philoso688phy of judicial restraint—what I am really trying to protect is toprevent the
                    courts from stepping into legislative business.I mean, we will be moving in and deciding what is
                    legislativebusiness, what is Presidential business and so forth. The legislativebranch ought to be
                    supreme in that area and not the courts. Butyou are quite right. If somebody had said—before Near v.
                    Minnesota,the great case involving prior restraints—if somebody had saidthere are no prior
                    restraints, it can never be, and then the troopship case comes up when the paper is about to publish
                    the detailsof a troop ship in the middle of a way, the courts tend to make anexception for
                    that.Maybe the same thing would happen here if it is the kind of adire circumstance where failure to
                    act is going to play into theSoviet Union's hands or something of that sort. I cannot foreclosethat
                    possibility.</p>

                    would have said this for the recordin any event. But I want to thank you for the way you have
                    conductedthese hearings. You have handled them very well. It hasbeen a very difficult job. You have
                    been under a lot of pressure, butyou have handled yourself and the committee extremely well and
                    Iwant to thank you for that.Again, Judge Bork, I have got to say good afternoon and complimentyou to
                    a considerable extent. This is my last round of questioningfor this forum. I will have a lot of
                    opportunities to questionother people about your qualifications, but I think I want to thankyou for
                    your historic appearance before this committee.I think your answers have been very sincere, most
                    thoughtful,and very complete. They have not only been complete to the questionsthat I have asked
                    you, but also to my colleagues—I thinkeven to those who had their minds made up two months ago.
                    Youhave been very thoughtful and sincere and most complete in youranswers.That is to your credit. I
                    respect you for that. I think, too, thatthere has not really been enough attention given to your
                    familyand supporters. I think they need to be commended as well for thegrace and extreme patience
                    that they have shown this week. Theentire family has my deep respect.Even though you have been the
                    one who has been on the firingline, I am sure that they felt some of the pressures, even part ofthe
                    pressure that you have had.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge, I think I have a theory that helps explainthe false and ridiculous
                    notion that you have changed yourviews here in order to improve your confirmation chances. This
                    isthe so-called "confirmation conversion" idea. It occurs to me—andthis comes after listening to you
                    for 3 days—that the real problemhere is that your views were so distorted for the past 2 months
                    thatpeople actually began to believe everything that they heard andread about you. People actually
                    started believing their own pressreleases, I believe.I must say that the way this campaign against
                    you have beenconducted is to the discredit of those lobbying against you. In anyevent, now that you
                    have explained why the campaign against youhas been nothing but one misrepresentation after
                    another—youhave been accused of changing your mind.This may be some sort of neat political trick,
                    but I think mostpeople see it for what it is. My deep regret about all of this is that Iwish your
                    Washington-lobbyist opponents had spent more timetaking the trouble to understand the powerful
                    reasoning behindyour philosophy rather than mis-stating the facts in that philosophy.Those are just
                    things that—you know, I am part of the processhere and I have got to make up my mind and be
                    responsible foreverything I do—but I guess I feel when people have suffered aninjustice, that
                    bothers me very much.Now I want to go on to some of the substantive things that Ihave asked you
                    about before, and I am going to pick up where weleft off yesterday. I asked you about the Finzer v.
                    Barry case, theD.C. Circuit case upholding the 500 foot limit on public demonstrationsin front of
                    embassies in the District of Columbia, and I explainedwhy I thought that the law was over-broad and
                    beyond thereasonable time, place and manner restrictions on the rights offree speech and assembly. I
                    also said that I was concerned aboutthis statute being selectively enforced.In fact, last year my
                    Judiciary subcommittee held hearings onthe very issue of selective prosecution in the District of
                    Columbia.We heard testimony, for example, that those arrested for protestingin front of the Soviet
                    Embassy were prosecuted while those arrestedin front of the South African Embassy were not
                    prosecuted.And you said yesterday that selective prosecution was not an issuein Finzer v. Barry and
                    I accept that.But you also said that the case would have been analyzed differentlyif there had been
                    such evidence. You even said that theresult might have been different. I would like to have you
                    elaborateon that. For instance, what is the test for selective prosecution,or how would your
                    analysis proceed if that had been the case?</p>

                    selective prosecution, if it is proved,may invalidate the prosecution, but not the law. It would
                    notchange the constitutionality of the law. It would probably invalidatethe prosecution.Selective
                    prosecution is hard to prove unless you have got a massivepattern. Now, maybe there is a massive
                    pattern in these twocases you mentioned. But I have never faced that. I have never hadto decide that
                    case and I do not want to decide it sitting here.</p>

                    appreciate the situation you might bein. We will drop it at that.This week we have heard a lot about
                    various speeches you havemade. I want to turn to a controversial speech that another Justicemade.
                    This past May, Thurgood Marshall created some public controversyof his own while he was giving a
                    speech on the Bicentennialof the Constitution. Justice Marshall stated at the outset ofthat speech
                    that he saw no reason to celebrate the achievements ofour Founders or the system of government they
                    created. And Idon't mean to quarrel with Justice Marshall. I am not here to dothat. I think I
                    understand his position because I did have a chanceto look at the entire speech. But I still found
                    these remarks somewhattroubling, especially coming from one sworn to uphold theConstitution he finds
                    defective.Are you familiar with Justice Marshall's comments? And, if youare, then I would like to
                    have your reaction to them?</p>

                    fairly well. And I like him.Having said that, let me just say, not by way of controversy, butthat I

                    they are going to win. But theydo deserve no less than a judge who has an open mind, one who
                    iswilling to hear them out. Time and again I think you have shownthis ability to rethink positions
                    in a rigorous and intellectuallyhonest way. My only regret is that all those in the chorus of
                    opposi693tion don't have the same skill. I wish these folks had some of thesame courage you have
                    shown.If they had it, they would have realized by now that you are preciselythe kind of thinker that
                    we ought to have on the SupremeCourt of the United States. They ought to be looking at you fromthat
                    standpoint. I hope that, after a week of you being here, peoplewill have a chance to study the
                    hearing record and give considerationto that.Judge Bork, we haven't had many questions about
                    criminal law.And maybe, of course, that is because there really is no Washingtonlobby that is pro
                    criminal. But nevertheless</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Yes. That was an enormous prosecution and trial,but—I mean, many charges and
                    defendants. But it turned out thata—it was a RICO—Racketeering, how is that? It was a
                    RacketeeringAct charge. But it turned out that one witness had sent outword that he couldn't sit or
                    something of that sort—not witness, Iam sorry. A juror had sent out word that he couldn't decide
                    thecase, and the judge questioned him.First, he complained about the statute. He didn't like the
                    statute.But then he said something that we thought had to be—the fullpanel we sat on—thought had to
                    be taken as a statement that hedidn't like the evidence, either.Well, it was a very awkward moment
                    for the trial judge. He didthe best he could; finally, he excused the juror. But we thoughtthat
                    there was too much chance, given what the juror had said,that a juror who did not accept the
                    Government's view of the factshad been excused from the jury, and therefore the defendant wasdenied
                    a trial by 12 jurors. And we reversed for that reason.We didn't reverse, we remanded for a new
                    trial. We didn't doanything else. But it looked very much as if—you could not say forsure that a
                    juror who had decided for innocence hadn't been excused.The trial judge didn't mean to do that, but
                    that is what thetranscript gave theimpression.</p>

                    course, there is the great Chief Justice JohnMarshall, but he had a unique situation he was in when
                    the Courtwas starting off. And then there was—William Howard Taft Ithink is a better judge, a better
                    Justice and deserves a bettermemory than he has, because he used to work carefully with
                    textualmaterials and historical materials to try to give a very balanceddecision about
                    constitutional matters.He also once held the chair that I later held at Yale, so I have togive him
                    credit for that. He was also Solicitor General and circuitjudge.Those were his most important
                    positions.Charles Evans Hughes I always thought was very good. RobertJackson I liked. Of course,
                    there are the great ones; you know,Holmes, whom I have been criticizing here, but he is clearly
                    agreat Justice. I mean, I criticized him on one case, which I havebeen arguing about. But he was
                    clearly a great Justice. RobertJackson I thought was good. There are a lot of them.</p>

                    because atrial lawyer really needs a lot of experience and a lot of knowledgeof technical nuances,
                    how to get evidence introduced and so forth,and maybe there ought to be a little additional training

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, lawyer advertising, I confess, doesn't botherme. Advertising for other
                    products is a way of bringing informationto consumers and making them aware of a range of choice. It
                    canalso be deceptive. I assume deceptive advertising by a lawyer couldbe punished.But I don't see
                    why—one of the problems with a lot of the citizenry,generally they have, is that they don't know
                    where to turnwhen they have a legal problem, and some of these new mass caselaw firms I think do a
                    good service in areas of routine wills, routinereal estate transactions, and so forth. They provide
                    services ata low price and I think, as I understand it, they are pretty good atit, and I think that
                    their existence and what they offer ought to bemade known.In addition to that, the commercial speech
                    aspect of the firstamendment seems to say that lawyer advertising cannot be prohibited.But, as a
                    policy matter, I am not really troubled by it.And judicial administration, the courts at all levels
                    are sufferingfrom enormous overload, and I think we are going to have to rethinkrearrangements of
                    courts and tribunals and jurisdictions inorder to cope with that problem. It is an enormous problem
                    and ittakes a long time to talk about it.</p>

                    because theytake up, you know—they take up a lot of time and money for theadversary who has to
                    defend it even if it is frivolous, and they takeup a lot of time and energy from courts that could
                    be better spenton more serious matters. But it is a tough problem, how to weedout the frivolous from
                    the one that maybe looks a little odd butturns out not to be frivolous.It is a serious problem and I
                    hope the bar, and the judiciary, andperhaps the Congress can deal with it, and find mechanisms to
                    dealwith it.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge, I am going to make a statement at theoutset with my friend from
                    Wyoming here, and he sure has been afriend, and I do not say that lightly. But I am going to
                    disagreewith him on something here.I want to, I think, put this in a slightly different perspective,
                    andI will just give you my perspective on this, and then I have severalquestions.It is true that
                    there are interest groups that are characterizingyou in ways that you have never heard me
                    characterize you, andyou never will hear me characterize you.I heard one interest group referred to
                    you as a Neanderthal. Ithink that is preposterous, and I think it is undignified, and I thinkit is
                    untrue. But just so we all understand how this works, one ofthe reasons maybe some of the groups are
                    upset is because of otherpeople.See, it's not only your adversaries but your friends who are
                    helpingyou, to paraphrase my friend from Wyoming.Jerry Falwell said, and I quote: "We are standing
                    at the edge ofhistory." This is on August 4th. "Our efforts have always beenstalled at the door of
                    the Supreme Court and Bork's nominationwill be our last chance to influence this most important
                    body."Most people, most Americans, although they have respect forJerry Falwell, do not doubt what
                    Jerry Falwell's political proclivitiesare.Then, a statement in the "Christian Voice" on July 27th,
                    afteryou were named, the following appeared:Ensure conservative America, even after President Reagan
                    leaves the WhiteHouse in 1988. We have a prime opportunity to give the Supreme Court its
                    firstconservative majority since 1930. Did you realize that Justice Powell was the decid697ing vote
                    in winning the last eight pro-abortion cases brought by the Supreme Court,by the American Civil
                    Liberties Union.There probably was a hiss when that was said. "ConfirmingJudge Bork would change all
                    of this." Let me just read, last, "Didyou realize"—this is a Christian Voice broadcast—"Did you
                    realizethat Justice Powell was the deciding vote in winning the last eightpro-abortion cases brought
                    by the Supreme Court, by the AmericanCivil Liberties Union. Confirming Judge Bork would change
                    allthat."There's many more quotes. I am not asking you to associate withthat at all. I know you do
                    not, either end. But the point is that thisthing feeds off itself.</p>

                <strong>Joe Biden Jr.</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">I was not suggesting you do, and that is whatthis hearing is all about. Our
                    debate is, at least yours and mine sofar, to the extent we have had a debate—not a debate so
                    much—but our differences, and I think they exist—they are about fundamentalrights and whether or not
                    they are found under the Constitution,within the Constitution.And Judge, one of the reasons why some
                    people on this panelhave raised the issue about consistency is that—a little bit "you'redarned if
                    you do, and you're darned if you don't." But your admissions,or, your admissions may be the wrong
                    word—it's too strong.Your assertions of change in positions that you have had—for example—the change
                    in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, you concludedlater was a good thing.And concluded that your 1971 view
                    was better than the view expressedin the 1968 "Fortune" article.Those, in the past at least, prior
                    to the changes, have in theminds of some of us resulted in an original view that you had, thatsome
                    of us find—and even you find—one you no longer accept.For example, on freedom of speech. That at
                    least the provocativestatement was enough to cause some of us—you have pulled awayfrom that bright
                    line you tried to draw, at least theoretically—toget upset. At least it got me upset.And in the
                    course of these hearings, there have been some—Iwould say they are close to revelations—regarding
                    your views onthe equal protection clause, underlying equal protection, the advocacyof civil
                    disobedience under the first amendment, and nowthere seems to some of us a change in your view on
                    precedent.I am not doubting you changed, but it seems as though you have.And all this leads me to
                    believe that as we debate this 200-year-olddocument, and we are still on the same fundamental
                    debate, thatis, the role of individuals and the rights of individuals relative tothe majority and to
                    government generally.And you have indicated you will apply your underlying principlesin concluding
                    how to vote on cases, and some of us—I, forone—think that the underlying principles are principles
                    that will—not because there is any malevolence on your part, not because youpersonally believe the
                    conclusions should be what it would be—force you to conclusions with which I have strong
                    disagreements.The tension between the individual and the government has beena debate that has
                    focused the attention of every generation ofAmericans for 200 years, and each generation, as I see
                    it, has withthe exception of the brief period in the Lochner era, has expandedthose rights, those
                    individual rights relative to the Government,relative to economic power.And it seems to me that that
                    battle is going to continue, and thatthe Court will have to play a very pivotal role as to whether
                    or notthe Constitution embraces the expansion, the continued expansionof individual rights.And I
                    want a Court that continues to mature in the way inwhich I think society is maturing. Society now
                    recognizes, and theCourt protects—and I am sure you will agree it should—my 6-yearolddaughter's
                    right to think about being President of the UnitedStates, which was a preposterous notion 50, 70,
                    100 years ago.She has as much right to think about that as she grows up as mytwo sons do. Our
                    society recognizes that in our complex world thereare almost as many divorced people as there are
                    married people,and maybe we should evolve the right, the constitutional maritalright, the
                    constitutional right of a parent, whether married or not,to see their child.The Court protects art,
                    for no other reason than it is art. Noother reason. Just because it ennobles us. It raises us up. It
                    makesus laugh. It makes us cry. It has no relationship to anything else.Just simply because it is
                    there.Just simply because it makes us feel good. Simply because it isprovocative, even though it has
                    no relationship to any political context,no relationship to political speech or political
                    discourse.And Judge, with notable exceptions, at least in the first instance,based on your writings,
                    you and I have ended up at a differentpoint, a different spot. And I would like to go back now, and
                    I saythat by way of trying to explain why I think some people—and I,from reading the press, although
                    I have tried not to do that toomuch the last 2 days—reading the press, there is this questionraised
                    about whether you have flipped or changed, or moved.And so I do not ask this, and I hope you take me
                    at my word. Ido not ask these questions that I am about to ask—none of themare going to be sharp
                    questions—I do not ask them for any otherreason than trying to make sure I am able to mesh what has
                    beensaid.So if you will give me a few minutes here, and I am going to giveyou all the time in the
                    world to respond.I would like to start with—I realize we have been over it severaltimes—the equal
                    protection clause. Now, the equal protectionclause, as the Court has looked at it in the recent
                    past—and bythat, I mean the last generation or so; actually, the last 60, 80,maybe 90 years—has gone
                    through mild, at least—I think wewould acknowledge—changes.Now, you have stated—and I think you are
                    right—that the coreprinciple in the equal protection clause, the 14th amendment, wasrace; that was
                    the core principle. Yet, there are various tests thathave grown up. One was, as we spoke about, and
                    Senator Specterspoke at length about, and Senator DeConcini, the strict scrutinytest, which
                    basically says in matters of race, you had better havean overwhelming reason to make a distinction.
                    And I am not using,as my son would say, "lawyers' language" here; I am just trying tomake it as
                    colloquial but accurate as I can, so that I understand itas well as everyone else.Then the Court in
                    the Seventies began to apply an intermediatescrutiny test. That fell somewhere between strict
                    scrutiny and therational basis test. The rational basis test is a lot looser, as we
                    bothacknowledged, so that if in fact a legislative body had any rationalbasis to make the
                    distinction that was being made, then the Courtwould usually uphold it. But the Court started to
                    play around.They wanted to expand, as I view it, expand rights. And theybegan to apply this
                    intermediate scrutiny test—not as tough asstrict scrutiny, but not as easy as the rational basis
                    test.And then Justice Stevens said he did not like all these categories.He said there should be one
                    test, basically—the reasonablenesstest.Now, it seems to me—although I do not take issue with
                    JusticeStevens coming up with that—that that is almost a totally subjectivetest; that
                    reasonableness—my dear mother, God bless her—and I hope she was not taking the quote from anyone
                    else—and sheprobably did—"What is one man's meat is another man's poison,"or something like that—she
                    gets them mixed up, like I do.</p>

                    it aslate as 1986 and 1987—let us just stick with the first half of thatarticle.Now, you say—and I
                    think, to your credit, you are one of the fewpeople of late who has tried to come up with a
                    constitutional construct.Some of the law and economics folks have done the same;your colleagues, Mr.
                    Posner, and Mr. Easterbrook have attemptedit, and Mr. Winter, and others. But you say—and I
                    quote—"Butthis resolution of the dilemma"—the Madisonian dilemma you talkabout with great
                    eloquence—"imposes a severe requirement uponthe Court, for it follows the Court's power is
                    legitimate only if ithas and can demonstrate in reasoned opinions that it has a validtheory, derived
                    from the Constitution, of respective spheres of majorityand minority freedom. It does not have such
                    a theory, butmerely imposes its own value choice, or worse, if it pretends tohave a theory, but
                    actually follows its own predilections, the Courtviolates the proposition of the Madisonian model
                    that alone justifiesits power, and then necessarily, abets the tyranny either of themajority or the
                    minority."Now, that is a very eloquent and, I think, compelling, statement.I can think of no test
                    that would more violate the principle thatyou set out here than the reasonableness test, which is
                    totally subjective.I think we both have to acknowledge that a judge—and Iam not considering you
                    conservative, liberal—a judge can go anywherehe or she wants under that test. What is reasonable to
                    memay be totally unreasonable to Senator Humphrey, and what is totallyunreasonable to him may be
                    reasonable to me.Now, what I am trying to figure out is how you could possiblyadopt such a
                    subjective test as Justice Stevens has and particularlysince there is nothing that I have found in
                    any of your prior writings,any of your prior speeches, anything you have ever said priorto this
                    hearing starting, that you adopted the Stevens standard.That is the question.</p>

                    I rememberI was once arguing a case in the Supreme Court, andsomebody said what about strict
                    scrutiny. And I said, well, if yousay strict scrutiny, the case is over. And one of the other
                    Justicessaid that is right, it is a conclusory term; we say strict scrutinywhen we intend to strike
                    it down.In the past, they have said rationality when they intend to let itstand up. Intermediate
                    scrutiny—nobody quite knows what thatmeans. It goes all over the place. It is highly subjective. And
                    I donot think the reasonable basis test is that subject, but one couldargue about which one is more
                    subjective. But unless you are goingto compelling all the way, or unless you are going to let it

                    licensed as bartenders unless they are relatedto a male proprietor, and so forth. It just isn't much
                    of a test.But, passing that, I think the Court got off on the wrong foot because—and we are going
                    into an arcane area again—perhaps becausethey adopted the approach of what is known as Footnote 4
                    inthe Carolene Products case, which says we must protect discreteand insular minorities. And that
                    was minorities who are small,don't have much contact or connection with the rest of the society,and
                    aren't big enough to vote.If you approach the equal protection clause in that way, I take itwomen
                    would not be covered, because women are not a discreteand insular minority.</p>

                    automatic rule; it means that the judge shouldhonestly say, if I decide this case on these criteria,

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, that was sure the core of it, but let me tellyou this, if you are
                    doing an original-understanding approach tothe Constitution, the surest guide, the first guide, the
                    first thingyou turn to, is the text, and the text of this thing says "nor shallany person be denied
                    equal protection of the laws." That I thinkmeans that you don't say maybe they were thinking about
                    blacks,former slaves, and so forth, but they stated a principle that's broader.And we'll come to it
                    in a minute—I'm not so sure they werethinking about that—maybe, I don't know. The language and
                    thehistory suggest that this group-by-group approach is misguided.Now, yesterday I think I mentioned
                    Congressman Bingham whowas the drafter of the equal protection clause, and when he wasspeaking to
                    the Congress in support of it he said "Is it not essentialto the unity of the government and the
                    unity of the people that allpersons, whether citizens or strangers within this land, shall haveequal
                    protection in every state?" And then there was SenatorHoward, a member of the committee that drafted
                    the 14th amendment,and its manager on the floor, on the Senate floor, and hesaid "The equal
                    protection clause abolishes all class legislation inthe states and does away with the injustice of
                    subjecting one casteof persons to a code not applicable to another."So my point is I think it's more
                    faithful to the language, and atleast to what Senator Howard and Congressman Bingham said, tosay,
                    look, this thing applies to all people, it applies to any person;there is no reason to say this
                    group gets this scrutiny, this groupgets this scrutiny; it is much easier to say we are going to
                    askwhether a distinction made between persons is a reasonable way toaccomplish a valid legislative
                    purpose. Now, that means that thelaw is going to change over time, that is, understanding of
                    reasonablenesschanges over time in the society. But that is true of ourunderstanding</p>

                    I am not in any way misleadingyou.You started off—the reason why there is some concern on mypart, at
                    least, is you say there are dozens of cases that should bereconsidered. Some of the dozens of cases
                    may be some of the onesyou have written about—we don't know. Some of the ones you havewritten about,
                    if you mean they should be reconsidered, scare theliving devil out of some of us, like me.If you
                    think that you should reconsider the rationale, the rationalein Griswold, it worries the devil out
                    of me. If you mean youthink you should reconsider the rationale in Roe, it worries a lot ofother
                    people. If you mean you consider the rationale—and I can godown the list.Now you have said that you
                    know what those cases are, at leastin your quotes, these dozens, and yet you have come back and
                    youhave made, at least you have left the impression with me that theprecedent is so binding
                    generally that you are really not going togo look at any of these cases.So you have Orrin Hatch
                    reading a list of all these cases that wehave raised as concerns, as if to say: Isn't it ridiculous,
                    Judge? Youwould never reconsider those cases. So there is a dilemma here.</p>

                    still really disturbs me in terms of notbeing fully embraced, and that is what was referred to, I
                    have beenreferring to as the marital right of privacy.Judge Bork, there has been a lot of
                    discussion, by me mostly Iguess, about that issue with you. So to make the facts clear, youand
                    others have basically said, that in the Connecticut case, theGriswold case, Connecticut made it a
                    crime for a married couple touse contraceptives. But there is another part of the law that madeit a
                    crime to give couples or anyone else information and adviceabout contraceptives. And the executive
                    director and medical directorof a birth control clinic were arrested because they examined awoman
                    and prescribed a contraceptive.The Supreme Court found that the criminal laws were
                    unconstitutional.Now they inferred with a right of—excuse of—they interferedwith the State by
                    talking about this right of marital privacy,which Douglas, as you have gone into detail about,
                    disagreeingwith, said was older than the Bill of Rights.Now I have got a real simple question. With
                    the views you havenow, had you been sitting on the Court, how would you have ruledon that case?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">It is quite clear. I think marital privacy is a rightolder than the Bill of
                    Rights, and that is why it has always beenrespected. Even in Connecticut, they didn't enforce that
                    lawagainst married couples and they had a terrible time, the Yale professorsdid, getting these
                    doctors arrested.But passing that, it is a right deeply built into our society, andno doubt about
                    it. But, if I were sitting on the Court and JusticeDouglas circulated that essay about emanations
                    and penumbras resultingin a generalized right of privacy, which is wholly undefinedand we don't know
                    where it will go next—no, I would not haveagreed to that opinion.Marital privacy is a very important
                    thing. And if a case came upin which I had to think about a constitutional principle, I wouldthink
                    very hard because it is so important. However, if when I wasfinished thinking I could make no
                    legitimate constitutional case, Iwould not make a decision that was not justified by the
                    Constitution.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">I believe so.The CHAIRMAN [continuing].And myself, I write this letter to
                    clarify the legal situation as it existed in Connecticutprior to the decision in Griswold v.
                    Connecticut. There is a decision of the ConnecticutSupreme Court of Errors, dated March 6, 1940, a
                    copy of which is enclosed.You will note that there was a prosecution of two doctors and a nurse in
                    violation ofthe Connecticut statute against the use of contraceptives.The case did not go beyond the
                    highest court in Connecticut; however, as a resultof this decision, nine Planned Parenthood clinics
                    which had been providing contraceptiveservices until they were closed, remained closed until the
                    decision of theUnited States Supreme Court in Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965. During the
                    interveningperiod, efforts were made to bring the question of constitutionality of theConnecticut
                    statute to the U.S. Supreme Court. Although the Court did not reviewin two cases prior to Griswold,
                    they decided against the opponents of the statute ontechnical grounds.In the second of such cases,
                    there were dissents from the denial to pass upon thestatute by a leading conservative Justice and
                    leading liberal Justice. Both JusticesHarlan and Douglas dissented in separate findings, stating
                    that in their view theConnecticut statute violated a basic constitutional right of privacy, a
                    position whichthe majority of the Court adopted later in Griswold, in 1965.The citation of State v.
                    Nelson Godrich, etc., are 126 Conn. 412—Well, I won't go through that.The citation of the third
                    case—I will skip that, too.Katherine Rohrbach represented the Planned Parenthood League of
                    Connecticutfrom 1955, and I have represented the Planned Parenthood Federation of Americasince 1940.
                    From 1940 until the decision in the Griswold case, no birth control serviceswere available to
                    Connecticut women who could not afford the price of a privatephysician.The whole point being very
                    clear, Judge. That that case, as atleast these two attorneys argue, the reason they wanted the
                    testcase was the Planned Parenthood outlets had been shut down bythe 1940 case, and poor women
                    couldn't get contraceptives butwealthy women could.I don't think that is true that poor women
                    couldn't.But, anyway</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, I want to turn to a subject on
                    the finality of SupremeCourt decisions in terms of interpreting the Constitution.This picks up a
                    somewhat broader subject than Marbury v. Madison.There has been some discussion of Marbury v.
                    Madison, not awhole lot.There are some prominent people in our country today whoappear to be
                    questioning the finality of Supreme Court decisions.One Presidential candidate flatly questions the
                    finality of the SupremeCourt decisions, saying, as I understand his comments asprinted in an
                    extensive article in the Washington Post that thePresident has authority to interpret the
                    Constitution, that the Congresshas the authority to interpret the Constitution, as co-equalbranches,
                    notwithstanding what the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates has said.There has been a statement made
                    by Attorney General EdwinMeese which borders on that conclusion. Attorney General Meesemay not have
                    intended to reach that conclusion as he addressed anop-ed piece to the Washington Post after a
                    speech he made atTulane on October 21, 1986.But I believe that this raises the most fundamental
                    question forthe Supreme Court and for the Constitution, and it is a question inmy judgment of
                    enormous importance. And Attorney GeneralMeese said this:But as constitutional historian, Charles
                    Warren, once noted, what is most importantto remember is that "however the Court may interpret the
                    provisions of theConstitution, it is still the Constitution which is the law, not the decisions of
                    theCourt." By this, of course, Charles Warren did not mean that a constitutional decisionby the
                    Supreme Court lacks the character of law. Obviously, it does have bindingquality. It binds the
                    parties in a case and also the executive branch for whateverenforcement is necessary, but such a
                    decision does not establish a supreme law ofthe land that is binding of all persons and parts of the
                    Government henceforth andforever more.Now what troubles me about this statement is that
                    AttorneyGeneral Meese appears to be giving support to what CharlesWarren says; that even after the
                    Supreme Court has made a decisionit is the Constitution which is the law, suggesting some
                    differencefrom what the Court has said. And then, Mr. Meese's ownwords, saying that the Supreme
                    Court decision has a binding qualityfor the parties in the case, and also the executive branch
                    forwhatever enforcement is necessary, suggesting that the SupremeCourt decision does not bind beyond
                    that range.My question to you is do you agree with what Attorney GeneralMeese has said?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I am not quite sure what it means, Senator,but let me say this. He
                    started off that somebody said that the Congressand the President can also interpret the
                    Constitution, whichis quite true. When the Congress decides to pass a statute, itmust—it should,
                    since they have taken an oath to defend the Constitution,think about the constitutionality of what
                    it proposes todo. When the President is about to act, he should—she should, ifwe should have
                    one—think about it, too; and usually he gets advicefrom the Office of Legal Counsel about the
                    constitutionality ofwhat the President proposes to do.But having done that, the Supreme Court—the
                    courts and ultimatelythe Supreme Court, are the final determiners of what theConstitution is. But
                    when the Court decides a case, I think as AbeLincoln said in his debates with Steven Douglas about
                    the DredScott decision, he has no desire to challenge that decision or saynobody is bound by it, but
                    you are free to go back and ask theCourt in a future case to change its mind.And I think that is
                    true for a while. Professor Herbert Wechsler,I think it was, who said that you can ask the Court to
                    rethink untilit becomes clear that it is settled, and when it is settled, it is settled.And this
                    ties into, of course, the discussion we have had aboutprecedent and respect for it. Courts can
                    rethink, but it may be, as Ihave said before, too late to rethink for a variety of reasons.</p>

                    which has been the subject of somediscussion as to standing. But in your enumeration of the powers
                    ofthe President, you said this in your dissent, at page 55 of the opinion:It—referring to the
                    Constitution—quote, was to allow roomfor the evolution of the powers of various offices and
                    branches, thatthe Constitution's specification of those powers was made somewhatvague. The framers
                    contemplated organic development, not astructure made rigid at the outset by rapid judicial
                    definition ofthe entire subject as if from a blueprint."There, obviously, you treat executive powers
                    as a blueprint inthe Constitution with a fuller statement to be developed as organiclaw.Why not such
                    a similar interpretation for the Bill of Rights?Why the necessity to find a specific constitutional
                    right as a prerequisitefor dealing with State legislative action?</p>

                    debate with my colleagues over this—and the colleagueI was having the debate with was Judge
                    Scalia—was in theOilman case, where I found a column protected by the first amendment.And as I
                    explained there, there will be an evolution of theBill of Rights as new threats to the freedoms
                    guaranteed develop—whether those threats are developments in legal doctrine, as inlibel law, or
                    threats coming from technology, or whatever it is; andyou do have an organic growth. And there is a
                    lot of freedom inthat. I mean, these are questions of degree and questions of judgment,which is why
                    you need judges and not just read the Constitution.But I do not think that I can ever justify a
                    judge putting a freedomor value in the Constitution that the framers or the ratifiersin no way
                    contemplated. Now, they did not contemplate the circumstances,so you may get an evolution for that
                    reason. They didnot contemplate future developments, so you may get an evolutionof a value that is
                    in the Constitution. But I think they have to putthe value there.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, the difficulty, I think, Senator, is that if Idecide that I am going
                    to protect liberty, just in general, not withoutany specific provision of the Constitution, then I
                    have no—obviously,I cannot say everybody is free to do whatever they want todo, and no statute may
                    exist because it interferes with liberty; wecannot have anarchy. So then I have to define what
                    liberties—Ihave to define it without guidance from the Constitution—what libertiespeople ought to
                    have and what liberties they ought not tohave.Now, that is exactly the effort I engaged in for about
                    6 or 7 yearsin that course on constitutional theory that I thought with AlexBickel. And I became
                    convinced that it was an utterly subjectiveenterprise and that I was running my values into what I
                    wascoming up with. I do not know—each of us may have a differentidea about what liberty requires.
                    And if we have no guidance fromthe Constitution itself, it is just the judge legislating the
                    Constitution—you know, if a judge said, "I think I will enact a statute," wewould all recognize that
                    that was improper. But a statute, I assumeCongress could repeal. If a judge legislates the
                    Constitution, I thinkthe situation is far more serious, and I do not want judges, includingme, going
                    around, saying, "You have this liberty, you do nothave that liberty," and I cannot explain why I got
                    it.</p>

                    interpreted the decisions, includingHolmes and Black and Frankfurter, there are traditional
                    expansionsof liberty very much within the framework that you articulatein Barnes v. Kline and that
                    you applied in the Oilman case, interms of the contours of the law which do not have any more
                    specification.For example, Frankfurter, whom you characterized as one of thestars of the Supreme
                    Court, had this to say in Roshin v. California—and I hope to take up with you some criminal law
                    cases at alater time and some of the due process considerations generally,but it fits in right
                    here—this is what he said in citing traditionfrom Cardozo—and it might be worth just a moment of
                    explanationto say that Roshin was a criminal law case where police officers inCalifornia broke into
                    a person's house and pumped his stomach,and the Supreme Court suppressed the evidence and found for
                    thedefendant in the case. And Frankfurter quotes Cardozo as sayingthere are values, quote, "so
                    rooted in the tradition and conscienceof our people as to be ranked as fundamental"—language which
                    isvery close to what your colleague Professor Bickel used. And thenFrankfurter says, "The vague
                    contours of the due process clause donot leave judges at large.' That is what you are concerned
                    about.And Frankfurter goes on and says, "We may not draw on ourmerely personal and private notions
                    and disregard the limits thatbind judges in their judicial functions. Even though the concept ofdue
                    process of law is not final and fixed, these limits are derivedfrom considerations that are fused in
                    the whole nature of our judicialprocess." And he refers to Cardozo's "Nature of the
                    JudicialProcess", one of the most famous law books ever written, that Iknow you are familiar
                    with.Now, that is the contour of the interpretation of the law. That isthe contour you follow in
                    Oilman. That is the contour you articulatein Barnes v. Kline. Why not a similar contour for liberty?

                    the kinds of categories that have beenbuilt up in libel cases in the past, rhetorical hyperbole and
                    so forth;actual malice, all that. There is a whole structure there.Now, we should remind ourselves
                    that there was a time whenthe word "liberty" in the 14th amendment was used by judges tostrike down
                    social reform legislation. They struck down minimumwage laws in the name of liberty; they struck
                    down laws in theLochner case, law regulating the hours that bakers could work.They went through
                    social reform laws very fast, in the name of liberty,and struck them down. And I cannot say they are
                    right orwrong about liberty. I can say they were wrong because they wereusing a concept to reach
                    results they liked, and the concept did notconfine them, and they should not have been using that
                    concept.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">He used the contract clause, and he also usedthe language which is more
                    generalized, and this is what Fletcherv. Peck held. And when you say it is vague and generalized,
                    Iwould not disagree with that. You can say that about most of theSupreme Court decisions, with all
                    due respect. But he says this, atpage 139 of the opinion: "If a State is neither restrained by
                    thegeneral principles of our political institutions, nor by the words ofthe Constitution, from
                    impairing the obligation of its own contracts,such a defense would be a valid one."Well, that is
                    fair to read as an alternative holding to freedom ofcontracts or to the "general principles of our
                    political institutions".So you go back to 1810, with Marshall, in Fletcher v. Peck, on thepower of
                    the court again and again and again.And I grant you that the Lochner decision is a bad one. And
                    Ithink the Court is going to come to bad decisions. But a more fundamentalissue for me is what is
                    the power of the Court to do; andif you restrict the power of the Court to an articulated right,
                    thenyou very much limit, as I see it, the tradition of the Court.And I see in your own writing,
                    Barnes v. Kline, when you dealwith executive and congressional power, and it raises a questionwhich
                    I would like your comment on, a question raised by others,as to whether there is not a broader
                    expanse as you interpret law,Judge Bork, if it comes to Congress or if it comes to the executive,as
                    contrasted with the interpretation of law as it relates to the individual,that individual liberty.

                    the fact is I have decided some constitutionalcases, I have decided first amendment cases, and found
                    for individualliberty. I decided a double jeopardy clause case just the otherday and found for
                    individual liberty. There is no problem that way.My only problem is I do not want to be a
                    free-floating legislator ofconstitutional law; I just do not.Once a judge gets to the point where he
                    says he is allowed to usethe concept of liberty to do whatever he thinks liberty requires,then in a
                    nomination hearing like this, that judge should be askedto make campaign promises about what he
                    thinks liberty requiresin specific instances, so that you would be satisfied he is going todo the
                    right thing.And we have been proceeding on the assumption, which I thinkis quite correct, that I
                    should not be asked to make promises aboutparticular cases. But if I am free to decide liberty, then
                    you oughtto ask me what I am going to do about the minimum wage law.</p>

                    andthat gives a Supreme Court Justice perhaps a little more courage—except, perhaps, for Senators
                    who have repetitive profiles in courage—but the history of our country has been that the Congress
                    hasrefused to act, and the executive has refused to act. And you werequoted as saying that Plessy v.
                    Ferguson had ceased to be equalwith being separate in the 1920's, 1930's and 1940's, and it
                    tookuntil the 1950's for the Supreme Court to decide the case. Andthere has been a reliance by the
                    people of this country on thecourts as a refuge when they cannot get legislative bodies to
                    actbecause of unwillingness to face the kinds of tough decisions or executives,because the other
                    side of the coin of being elected is thatthere is a tremendous inertia and unwillingness to face
                    problems,and the insulation that judges have has provided the tradition, andthe tradition of the
                    Supreme Court of the United States, to makegood faith interpretations in an expansive way.And that
                    is really what I am looking to, because I think that isthe tradition of the Court.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, I think it is fine for you to do justicein Rochin without the
                    due process clause if you can find it.Now the question is how are you going to do justice in
                    privacycases without the due process clause—if you can find an alternative,that is fine. But what I
                    am looking for and what I think thetradition of the Court has been is not to be hidebound by
                    beingable to find a specific right if it comports to fundamental principlesrooted in the conscience
                    of our tradition, which is the Cardozo language,or fundamental considerations of fairness. And in
                    thenature of the judicial process that we have had since 1810, Fletcherv. Peck, there is that really
                    well-established tradition.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">All right.Judge Bork, I was starting to comment about a strain in
                    yourwriting about the Constitution responding to the demands of thepeople—and here again you refer
                    to Bickel with some frequency—and that if the Court makes a decision that does not have
                    popularsupport, it will change; or if the Court makes an opinion whichdoes have substantial minority
                    opposition, in the absence of somemajority support, it will change. And you made an interesting
                    commentin the League of Women Voters publication, this year, 1987,where you said, talking about the
                    evolution of constitutional doctrine,referring to Supreme Court Justices, quote, "Furthermore,they
                    are screened through a Senate Judiciary Committee, whichhas become, I think, increasingly
                    sophisticated"—one of your commentswhich may not draw any objection from this panel—"aSenate
                    Judiciary Committee, which has become, I think, increasinglysophisticated; that what is at stake are
                    constitutional issues.So in the long run, the Constitution is not merely what the judgessay it is,
                    but what the people want it to be."Now, if a Constitution can be influenced by a sophisticatedSenate
                    Judiciary Committee and can be responsive to what thepeople want it to be, then why the harsh
                    constricture that a righthas to be specified before you would interpret it through a very
                    importantAmerican value?</p>

                    a political pressure in the society for certain results, asthere was in the New Deal to expand the
                    commerce power beyondwhat the Court was currently willing to let it be, the Court cannotforever
                    withstand that strong political pressure, if for no otherreason than that Justices die and retire,
                    and the President willnominate somebody whose views are more expansive about thecommerce
                    clause—which is precisely what happened in the NewDeal era. And the Senate will confirm them, and
                    you will get a defacto change in the Constitution, not because the document is flexible,but because
                    human beings come and go.</p>

                    rounds, I think. As Senator Specter haspointed out, there are a lot of unanswered questions and a
                    lot ofthem that you have answered for me—though I may not agreewith them, you have answered them,
                    but some I do agree, or atleast I am satisfied.I am concerned—and this is really not addressed to
                    you; it is addressedmore to the White House—one of the records that havebeen put together regarding
                    your record on the circuit court is interesting,and I have read it, and I do not know if you
                    approved it,but it points out some pretty good statistics on reversals and howmany cases you have
                    handled.But Judge Bork, can you tell me if any of the majority opinionswhich you wrote have ever
                    been considered by the Supreme Court?</p>

                    see it. It says that hedoes not support or oppose Judge Bork. And I think it is importantthat the
                    record be as clear and concise as it can be that DeanMarcus did not want his name used without his
                    permission, althoughhe says in the letter, clearly, taking the view that, "Itwould be presumptuous
                    for me to support or oppose Judge Bork'snomination," and he explains the constitutional reasons.So
                    without objection, Mr. Chairman, I will ask that it be part ofthe record.</p>

                    one of your colleagues, JudgeGordon, regarding a panel that you sat with with Judge Robb. Ionly read
                    in the newspaper what some of the clerks said and whatyour response was. And I would like to turn to
                    that for a moment.It relates, of course, to the opinion in Vander Jagt v. O'Neill. And Iam not so
                    much interested in the opinion, because I am really not;I am interested in the problem that is
                    raised here that you may beable to clarify completely as to the ethical standard that is used
                    byjudges.Is it correct to say that, although you had agreed to write a majority-based opinion on
                    numerous reason, it was agreed that theopinion would not be based on standing, as clearly stated in
                    thememorandum from Judge Robb dated March 19, 1982?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">That is fair enough. After receiving a copyof your September 17 letter to
                    Judge Gordon, Judge Robb respondedby saying he was "surprised" to have your proposed opinionbased on
                    standing, and that he could not agree with the reasoning.In this same letter, Judge Robb suggested
                    that Judge Gordonprepare an opinion based on something other than standing, asoriginally agreed in
                    the conference back in March of 1982.Then further, on October 8, 1982, you sent a letter to both
                    JudgeRobb and Judge Gordon, and in that letter you characterized yourfailure to notify Judge Gordon
                    of your decision to write the opinion,based on a different reasoning than originally agreed to, as
                    follows:"Inexcusable. I neglected to write to Judge Gordon about mychange of opinion." End of quote.
                    That was in your letter.Now, it concerns me—the doctrines, we could talk about, butthat really is
                    not necessary—there seems to be some question as towhat took place during the period after you
                    agreed to draft theopinion and the actual drafting. That is not so much the change ofheart that I
                    have a question with—I think judges are entitled tochange their minds and to try to convince their
                    colleagues on apanel to change their minds—but rather, the way in which youcommunicated this change
                    particularly to Judge Gordon.In your letter of October 8, 1982, you wrote that although youhad
                    spoken to Judge Robb concerning your change in approach,Judge Robb did not remember speaking to you;
                    did not doubt thatit took place, but was certain that he did not understand what yousay that you had
                    proposed.Now, is that correct, and can you tell me more about really whattook place so I can have a
                    clear understanding?</p>

                    factwas; that as I started on the opinion, I thought it was harder to getthe case out under either
                    the political question doctrine or thespeech or debate clause. And the Supreme Court's opinion
                    inValley Forge made it easy to dispose of it on standing grounds.And in addition to that, we had
                    coming up for en bane rehearingin our court a challenge to the Senate and the House of
                    Representatives'paying of chaplains. The case demanded that you not paychaplains any salary on the
                    grounds it violated the establishmentclause. And in the middle of that case was going to be the
                    politicalquestion doctrine and perhaps the speech and debate clause. And Idid not want to publish a
                    panel opinion taking a hard position onthat, and then the en bane thing comes along and maybe wipes
                    outthe rationale I use in this case.So my clerk and I—Paul Larkin, his name is—discussed this, andI
                    said to him, and he remembers this, that I was going to go up andtalk to Judge Robb about using
                    standing instead. And I did go up,and we had a long talk. And I am told by Judge McKinnon on
                    ourCourt that Judge Robb's secretary at the time remembers me goingup to talk to him about this.I
                    did talk to him about it, and he agreed with me.</p>

                    Well, anyway, this is what I got backfrom Judge Gordon, with his final draft. He discusses what he
                    hasdone to the draft, and so forth and so on, and he would appreciateit if he could have my law
                    clerk ring up to work on circulating theopinion and so forth, process the opinion.And the last
                    paragraph of this letter of December 17th says,"May I take this opportunity of expressing to you my
                    pleasure insitting with you last March, and the making of your acquaintance,and I wish you and yours
                    a happy and joyous Yuletide season."That was the only sentiment he expressed to me from then
                    untilnow.</p>

                    Gordon a memorandum, and in ithe said, "Now, I am surprised to have Judge Bork's proposed
                    opinion,holding that the plaintiffs are out of court because they haveno standing to sue. Although I
                    agree with the results, I regret thatI cannot concur in the opinion. I would apply the Riegle theory
                    tothis case. The Valley Forge case relies on it, and the proposed opinionwas not a case of the
                    congressional plaintiff, and I see nothingin it that suggests that the Court would not have approved
                    the applicationof the Riegle theory in a congressional plaintiff context."Doesn't this refute what

                    Andafter discussing one particular case, the Aguilar case, you go on tosay, quote, "I suspect that

                    told you about an embarrassmentand conflicting experience by an eighth-grade boy who wasinstructed
                    by his Jewish parents not to read the Bible or leadprayer in classroom devotions dominated by
                    Christians.And Reverend Dean says in a news article there, that you responded,"Well, I suppose he
                    got over it, didn't he?"In view of that remark, first of all, is that your remark, and secondly,with
                    the constraints of not commending on how you woulddecide religious cases, the establishment cases
                    and establishmentclause, can you give us some idea of what do you believe theFounding Fathers

                <p class="short_transcript">Okay. Judge Bork, I only say this to you becauseI think you have devoted a
                    lot of time to this, and it is veryimportant to you, as it is to me. I cannot think of a more
                    importantdecision that Congress makes than confirmation of all judges, butcertainly, the Supreme
                    Court judges. And I welcome any writtenresponses you want after you look at this record, because the
                    equalprotection clause bothers me a great deal. We have gone over itand over it, and I am not going
                    to go over it again.The right of privacy concerns me. You have responded in someareas, particularly
                    the Dronenberg case yesterday. I was very concernedabout those 10 pages of what I consider
                    philosophizing. Iaccept your answer to that, that they were taken up, all of thosepoints. I have not
                    read that, but I have no reason to dispute you.Your explanation of the firing or discharge of
                    Archibald Cox, althoughI do not agree with that, I have no reason to dispute whatyou said there.But
                    I am greatly concerned, as has been expressed by a numberof people on this panel, this committee,
                    and the people that Italked to, about your inability to find a right of privacy as it relatesto the
                    Connecticut case that we have gone over and over here,either in the ninth amendment or something.
                    And with the outstandingintellectual capacity that you have and experience, I findthat very
                    difficult, but I accept that that is your position—and alsoon the equal protection clause.I say that
                    to you because it is up to you whether or not you wantto rehash this in writing for me. That is not
                    an assignment, by anymeans, and I do not want to leave it with you that that is going tomake the
                    difference. But I am very concerned about it, and I meanthat sincerely. I feel some emotion tied to
                    it. I have two daughters;one is a doctor, and one is going to be a lawyer. And if they weretruck
                    drivers in heavy equipment, I would feel the same way.I want to be satisfied not only for my
                    daughters, but for allwomen, that they would have really equal opportunity before theeyes of the
                    nominee. And you have not convinced me of that, al734though you have gone over it a great deal, and
                    if there is anythingyou want to add to the record, I will be more than happy to considerit.I do not
                    make these judgments on one, single issue. I have saidthat many times. I would not vote against you
                    or would not votefor you because you happen to come down on a side that I like, ordisagree with my
                    own value system. This disturbs me, the equalprotection, and</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I find it very difficult, coming fromwhere you have come from, your
                    very strong views as to the 14thamendment early on; your acceptance a few days ago, the firsttime
                    that I found that you do apply it to women—that is very positive.I do not say that critically.
                    Although some will hold you suspectfor that, I say, hey, that is positive. Here is a jurist and
                    anacademic, a professor, who is willing to move and expand; that isgood.Then we get into this
                    argument of the standards that you apply,and the fact that you—and you cite Justice Stevens—have
                    come upwith something new. That concerns me, because this is such a fundamentalbelief that I have in
                    the equal protection clause as it appliesto women.I am worried about you have a standard out here of
                    reasonablenesswhere all the other judges, including Rehnquist in a couple ofhis dissents, used the
                    rational basis, or the intermediate basis, oron race cases, the strict basis.</p>

                    why the amendment applies to allpeople. But on this, you know, I have been teaching those cases
                    inwhich they applied the equal protection clause to women before,and I have never criticized them,
                    never complained about them.The only trouble with them is they applied the lowest level of
                    scrutinythey could find, so that they had these ridiculously discriminatorystatutes, which I
                    criticized in class.There was the case when they say a woman can't be licensed asa bartender unless
                    her husband owns the place. They applied theequal protection clause, but they upheld the
                    distinction. Now, Inever complained about applying the clause. All I ever complainedabout was
                    upholding the distinction.</p>

                    requestfor that at this point. I assure you I have no desire whatsoever,much I have learned to enjoy
                    your company, to ask you tocome back barring something extraordinary that would happen inthe public

                    speak for the Democrats on that. The rankingmember speaks for the Republican. That is the deal, and
                    if you canhang on for what will amount to another 43 minutes tonight, wewill finish for tonight—30
                    plus 10 plus 3.So I now yield to the Senator from New Hampshire for his 10minutes tonight.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you.Mr. Chairman, at this hour as is usual thereis a certain
                    mellowness and camaraderie in the air, but that hasn'tbeen the case at other times in this day or in
                    other days, and thereare certain things that have transpired that I want to address asmy last part
                    in this hearing today.The Senator from Massachusetts in his summation noted thatthe record speaks
                    for itself, and indeed it does. It is unfortunate,however, that some are so deaf they cannot hear
                    the record speak.It is unfortunate that some are so deaf they cannot hear what therecord of Robert
                    Bork the Solicitor General and Robert Bork theJudge says.And when that record speaks and is heard,
                    if anyone is listening,it says unequivocally that Robert Bork is a temperate, reasonableman. A man
                    it turns out who has decided as a judge in favor ofminority persons and women in 88 percent of the
                    civil rights caseswhich have come before him. The record says that Robert Bork is aman of fairness
                    and decency, of intellect and intellectual honesty.It is unfortunate that some refuse to listen to
                    the record, refuse tolisten to the most relevant of all possible testimony about whatkind of judge,
                    what kind of a Justice Robert Bork would make;namely, his exemplary and impeccable record as a judge
                    on our nation'ssecond most important court.Instead they insist almost exclusively on exhuming his
                    writingsas a college professor. Let me say something about those writings.They were available. Those
                    writings, same writings, were availablewhen this committee and the Senate scrutinized Robert Bork
                    5years ago for the judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals andwhen this body voted, without
                    dissent, to confirm him. Those writingswere available then.My point is this: If today those writings
                    can be claimed to provethat Robert Bork is an enemy of equality before the law for all
                    citizens,irrespective of race or sex, then the same claim could havebeen made on the same basis 5
                    years ago when he was before thiscommittee the last time. But no such claim was raised. That is
                    verypeculiar, isn't it? Very odd. Especially in light of the extraordinaryparallel between this
                    hearing for Robert Bork and that of ThurgoodMarshall in 1967. I saw parallel because, like Robert
                    Bork,Thurgood Marshall had served as both Solicitor General and a circuitcourt judge.Now, Mr.
                    Chairman, let me quote our distinguished colleague,the Senator from Massachusetts, from his
                    statement before thiscommittee on that occasion; that is, in the 1967 hearing on ThurgoodMarshall.
                    These are the words of the Senator from Massachusetts:"Mr. Chairman, I would like to add one final
                    thought"—hiswords in part, of course. "Mr. Chairman, I would like to add onefinal thought. Judge
                    Marshall has undergone nominations hearingsbefore this committee twice in the last 5 years [just
                    like RobertBork]. Twice in the last 5V2 years and on the first occasion he wasnominated to the
                    second circuit and on the second he was nominat743ed to Solicitor General. In both of those hearings
                    this committeeheard ample proof of his fitness for high legal office, and his recordsubsequently has
                    only added to his qualifications. I, therefore,think we can move expeditiously ahead with his
                    confirmation."I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Chairman, that that passage beplaced in the record—in the
                    transcript.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">And the same thing can be said for RobertBork. He has been twice before this
                    committee, found fit, and, ifanything, his record has only been embellished since the last timehe
                    appeared before this committee.I find it peculiar, indeed, that some who voted for Judge Bork 5years
                    ago seem to have amnesia today about their vote. But theydid it, and as they say. the record speaks
                    for itself. This inconsistencydisturbs me because it does violence not only to Judge Borkand his
                    family; it does violence, it does an injustice to our country.Because, really, it pollutes and it
                    politicizes the confirmationprocess, a process which relies so heavily on good faith and
                    bipartisanship.Yes, politics. And that is the only possible explanation ofthe self-evident
                    inconsistency before us. Unless you can believe theamnesia theory, that is, you have got to see it
                    as politics. After all,Judge Bork's writings were available 5 years ago and they haven'tchanged in
                    the last 5 years. Politicizing the confirmation process isa very sad way, indeed, to celebrate the
                    200th anniversary of ourConstitution,Judge Bork, good luck to you. Chief Justice Warren Burgerindeed
                    was right when he described you as the best nominee forthe Supreme Court in the last 50 years. By
                    virtue of your superbqualifications, you deserve confirmation; and I believe that you willbe
                    confirmed because I cannot believe that the Senate will abide inpoliticizing the confirmation
                    process. That process is far too importantto sacrifice to short-term political expediency.I
                    relinquish the balance of my time.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At one time I alwaysliked to make those games. I,
                    one time, came to a soccer game outin McLean. My young son and the young son of now Justice
                    Scaliawas playing. It was a cold day and the kids were playing. The twoof us were sitting there kind
                    of muttering a bit. He mentioned hehad driven a few miles to get there. I told him that I had
                    startedout that day in Ankara, Turkey, to get there for that soccer game.The soccer game,
                    fortunately, the team of our sons won.But it is important to be there, and I mention that only as a
                    prelude.That same son with the rest of our family is—he is finishinghigh school in Vermont and the
                    family is up there, so I will not behere tomorrow, Judge Bork. I will be in Vermont. I have beendown
                    here now for the last 10 days. I also want to get home andsee my family. And I hope this does wrap
                    up soon so that you canhave the rest of the weekend with yours.You know, I said at the outset of
                    this hearing about the ratherunique character of a confirmation hearing. I said you might find
                    itpart trial by ordeal and part like a graduate seminar in constitutionallaw, and I think my
                    prediction was accurate.But I also predicted that the Committee's examination of youwould be long,
                    and I am sure you are ready to agree to that; that itwould be thorough; but I also felt it would be
                    fair and serious, andhere again I think I was right. We have heard some statementstoday and, in
                    fact, early in the hearing to the effect that the hearinghad taken on some characteristics of an
                    inquisition. Well, Ihave to object to that.I have been here throughout the hearings, not every
                    singleminute of it, but most of it. In fact, I think I have been here probablymore than anybody
                    else, or as much as any member of thiscommittee, and I haven't seen an inquisition. I have heard
                    somerepetitious questions. I have heard a great many leading questions,but I haven't heard any
                    unfair questions.As far as repetition is concerned, I think that I should say in defenseof the
                    committee that we have heard quite a few statementsfrom you, sir, on critical issues in this
                    proceeding that we had notheard before—not in your confirmation hearings or in your prolificwritings
                    or speeches or your judicial decisions. And every Senator,of course, has to look at that and judge
                    for himself what weight togive to this new information, to decide whether it was expected
                    orunexpected, but I wanted to mention that fact because I think thatgoes to why you have had to
                    answer sometimes the same questionsmore than once. Perhaps each of us see it a little bit
                    differently,each one of us has a particular interest and we would follow up onit.And so, you know,
                    sometimes the rhetoric about inquisition mayinspire the troops, but I don't think people who have
                    followed thesehearings closely and attentively would agree with that characterization.They haven't
                    seen an inquisition. They have seen a committee—an historic committee—of the U.S. Senate performing
                    oneof its most useful duties under the Constitution.I think we have done it with seriousness and
                    dignity, but also Imight say with a firm and fair hand wielding the gavel. But theyhave also seen a
                    nominee responding forthrightly and willingly indetail to the inquiries of members of this
                    committee, and I com748mend you for that. And also I would commend your wife and yoursons and your
                    daughter, who sat patiently throughout this, and Iknow that has been a long time for them and I
                    think that you, sir,should be very proud and appreciative of them, and I am sure youare.</p>

                    off yesterday, go back again to the areaof free speech, to a concept you have expressed frequently
                    in yourwritings, and that is the idea that the local community should havethe right to suppress
                    speech that doesn't meet the legal test of obscenityon the grounds that the speech is harmful to the
                    community'smoral standards.And, in your 1979 University of Michigan speech, you said, onpage 15,
                    "The Court tends to assume that there is not a problem ifwilling adults indulge a taste for
                    pornography in a theater whoseoutside advertising does not offend the squeamish. The assumptionis
                    wrong. The consequences of such private indulgence may havepublic consequences far more unpleasant
                    than industrial pollution.The attitudes, taste and moral values inculcated do not stay behindin the
                    theater. A change in moral environment—in social attitudestoward sex, marriage, duties toward
                    children and the like—may assurely be felt as a harm as the possibility of physical violence.
                    TheCourt has never explained why what the public feels to be a harmmay not be counted." And you made
                    similar comments.Now that quotation uses the word "pornography" and I knowyou have discussed here
                    the interchanging of it, but, as lawyers, weknow that pornography is one thing, obscenity is quite
                    another.The Supreme Court spoke to that distinction. That was the 1959case of Kingsley Corporation
                    v. Regents of the University of NewYork and I believe that may have a target of some of your
                    speeches.The State of New York had tried to ban a film, to quote fromthe Court's decision, because
                    "the whole thing of this motion pictureis the presentation of adultery as a desirable, acceptable
                    andproper pattern of behavior."Now, there was no contention the film was obscene. It was notbanned
                    under an obscenity statute. The Supreme Court in a nineto nothing decision held the first amendment
                    prevented the Statefrom banning this film "because this picture advocates an idea—that adultery
                    under certain circumstances may be proper behavior,"and then went on to say, "the first amendment's
                    basic guaranteeis the freedom to advocate ideas."Now, that was sort of a long lead in, not because I
                    am up here toadvocate or promote films advocating adultery but to follow up onan answer you gave to
                    Senator Specter. You told him on Wednesdaythat you believed that the Supreme Court is the ultimate
                    arbiterof whether a work is obscene and if a local community tried toban works that were not
                    obscene, the courts should prevent thatfrom happening; is that correct?</p>

                <strong>Patrick J. Leahy</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">AS an Anglo Saxon term and perhaps recognizedmore universally than you might
                    like. You have written about thatcase a number of times. In fact, you eloquently, I thought, put it
                    ina speech to the Justice and Society seminar in Aspen, CO. You saidthat, I guess, the defendant in
                    this case had worn on the back ofhis jacket a slogan, and I will quote you, that "suggested that
                    thereader perform a most implausible physical act with the draftlaw," close quote.And in fact,
                    having done that, he was convicted of disorderly conduct.The Supreme Court in that opinion by
                    Justice Harlan struckdown the conviction. Justice Harlan said the first amendment preventsgovernment
                    from distinguishing among words that peoplemight find offensive, prohibiting some, permitting
                    others.You sharply criticized that decision. The decision had asked howis one to distinguish this
                    from any other offensive words, or howcan the government constitutionally pick and chose among
                    wordswithout infringing free speech. And as I understand your Aspenspeech and several others, you
                    said they can pick and choose by thecommon sense of the community. And here, again, you believe
                    thecommunity ideas of morality should prevail over a first amendmentprotection of free speech.In
                    fact, on page 18 of your Michigan speech when you discuss theCohen case, you said, ' Far from
                    protecting such speech, it"—thefirst amendment—"offers additional reason for its suppression."Again,
                    a lengthy lead-in judge, only because I am wondering ifthis is inconsistent with what you told
                    Senator Specter about therole of the Federal courts to protect non-obscene free speech regardlessof
                    the views of even the majority of the local communitywhich might find the speech offensive.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">NO; I stated, and I still state, that in order to protectthe first amendment
                    guarantees of free speech, the Court hasto define what obscenity is and it may not allow a community
                    tooverride that. I object to Cohen v. California. I have here my FrancisBoyer lecture on this
                    matter, and what I said was—and I disagreedwith Justice Harlan on two grounds.He said: "The
                    principle contended for by the State seems inherentlyboundless. How is one to distinguish this from
                    any other offensiveword?"I then said: "One might as well say that the negligence standardof tort is
                    inherently boundless, for how is one to distinguish thereckless driver from the safe one? The answer
                    in both cases is bythe common sense of the community. Now, the common sense ofthe community, I take
                    it, is shared by the Supreme Court—wheth-er this is obscenity or not. Almost all judgments in law
                    are ones ofdegree and the law—not the community—the law does not flinchfrom such judgments except
                    when, as in the case of morals, it seriouslydoubts the community's right to define harms."Then I
                    went on to complain about Justice Harlan's second rationalewhere he said—these are my
                    words—apparently thinkingthe observation decisive, he said, and I quote him: "One man's vulgarityis
                    another's lyric."And then I said, on that ground it is difficult to see how law onany subject can be
                    permitted to exist because he said</p>

                    had been negligent driving when the judgeknew very well that there had not and that there was no
                    basis forthe verdict, he would set it aside. But in this case there is nothingin my writing to
                    suggest that any community can override theguarantees of the first amendment. No community can
                    overrideany guarantee anywhere in the Constitution, and no communitycan override the powers given to
                    Congress in the Constitution.That is not the way the Constitution operates and I have neversaid
                    otherwise. And here I said the law does not flinch from suchjudgments. The question of whether this
                    is an obscene word is, inthe first instance, for the community. It must decide whether itsobscenity
                    law applies to this word. Then the Court must decidewhether it is obscene within the meaning of the
                    first amendmentcase law. And if it is not obscene within the meaning of the firstamendment case law,
                    then the speech is protected.I have no problem with that. I have never said anything to thecontrary.

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, when was this? Because I may have said itmore recently even. But I
                    feel that the reasons given by JusticeHarlan, that is, how can anyone tell what is obscene and what
                    isnot—which the law assumes it can in a case like Pacifica and elsewhere—I feel that reason is not
                    adequate and I feel that statementthat one man's vulgarity is another's lyric is not adequate to
                    protectan obscenity.I feel about that precisely the same way as I did when I gave theBoyer lecture.

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you. This morning, in response to SenatorThurmond, you summarized much
                    of your testimony throughoutthis hearing about some important doctrines of constitutional law,and I
                    found that summary very interesting and I suspect all of usare going to go back and read and re-read
                    it as we go through this.But you described these doctrines as now firmly part of our law,that
                    whatever theoretical challenges might be available to them, itis too late for any judge to tear them
                    up. I think most, or I wouldassume everybody here agrees with that. But among the doctrinesyou
                    listed, some you have characterized in your writings—in fact,in your discussions with me—as too
                    firmly embedded in our law totear up.For example, the expansive interpretation of the
                    commerceclause, the legal tender cases that authorize the printing of papermoney. We all agree that
                    if you go back and suddenly say, wait aminute, that is wrong, then, of course, you would have to
                    have anew Supreme Court decision saying, for instance, plastic has takenover for it.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">But nobody questions that. I mean, that is wellsettled. But then there are
                    some doctrines in this category whichyou sharply criticize in your writings, but that you
                    characterized atthis hearing, and I think in some instances perhaps for the firsttime, or at least
                    the first time I have heard it, as too late to tearup.Let met go down through a couple of those if I
                    might. They includethe prevailing free speech doctrine, including the cases on advocacyof law
                    violation culminating in Brandenburg v. Ohio, andthe extension of first amendment protection of
                    speech that hasnothing to do with the political process. They include the expansionof the equal
                    protection clause to cover sex discrimination andother types of discrimination. At least you agree
                    in general withthe results that have been reached although you would have takena somewhat different
                    route to arrive there.I do not want to go out so far here that you do not have a chanceto come back.
                    Am I correct so far? Have I characterized your testimonycorrectly so far?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">But what about Griswold, Judge? Let's back upthere just a tad if we might.
                    You know, as has been said by manybefore me, democracy is a terrible system of government, except
                    itis the best we have. And our own system of government with thethree branches of government has to
                    be one of the most inefficient,unwieldy forms of government, but it is by far the best.Take the
                    average person. They see a legislature that may go offand do quirky things for whatever political
                    reasons, whether it isthe national legislature or a State legislature. And they see an
                    executiveperhaps indifferent to their wishes as they see them. Sothey always look to that one body,
                    the Court, that seems more independentthan the other two put together, less swayed by the passionsof
                    politics or the passions of the moment, and they go to it.We go back to the law in Griswold, and the
                    people say that is acrazy law. We all agree on that. Except, as Senator DeConcini haspointed out,
                    and I certainly from my experience as a prosecutorcan well concur, you sometimes find prosecutors
                    who will take alook at a crazy law and say, for whatever reason, I am bringingsome charges on that,
                    and then all of a sudden that crazy law thatwe all chuckled about becomes very real to some man or
                    womanwhen the indictment is handed down or the information is issuedand the police officer is at the
                    door.And so where do the people go? They go to the Court. And in thecase of Griswold, you are
                    sitting on a court reviewing that. I understandand accept what you say about the penumbra of privacy
                    andso on. But suppose they do not have a stare decisis, and supposethey do not have some other
                    theory. What do you do? You say,look, I am sorry; that is a crazy law but you just bought the
                    radish.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, the fact is, I have said from the beginningthat the mere fact that
                    a law is outrageous is not enough to makeit unconstitutional. If the statute in Griswold had ever
                    been enforcedagainst a married couple, or any couple, I think there mighthave been a very good
                    chance it would be an invalid conviction becausethere is no fair warning. Nobody ever applied the
                    law thatway. If they had applied the law that way, the law would havebeen repealed instantly.But
                    passing that, merely the fact that it is a dumb law gives theCourt no additional power because there
                    is no statement in theConstitution that no State shall make a dumb law. You referred tothe fact that
                    when people are dissatisfied with legislatures and executives,they always look to the courts. It is
                    also true that there isa great deal of dissatisfaction with the courts in this country.So that I do
                    not think that it is fair to say that the courts are theonly body of government which the people
                    trust. Some people do. Alot of people do not.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I see the privacy cases in any particular context—I mean, it has been
                    applied in a variety of ways—as still controversialcases. The Court is still divided about it. The
                    people arestill divided about it. It remains a live controversy in a way, ofcourse, the legal tender
                    cases do not.I would like to point out once more that the Constitution explicitlyprotects many
                    important aspects of privacy—the first amendment,fourth amendment, fifth amendment and so forth—so
                    it isnot a right of privacy I am opposed to. It is a generalized undefinedright of privacy that is
                    not drawn from any constitutional provision.Maybe it can be, but I have not seen it done yet.</p>

                    Senator Metzenbaum of a telegramfrom a woman who was involved in the lead case, the
                    sterilizationcase. And the lady sent the telegram. We found now this evening,or this afternoon, that
                    she—this is Betty J. Riggs—was contactedapproximately 2 weeks ago by an organization requesting that
                    shedo a TV ad opposing your nomination. She refused to do that.She was contacted today, September
                    18th, at approximately 1:00p.m. by her attorney, Joan Bertin, an ACLU representative out ofNew York,
                    as well as her attorney in the Cyanamid case. Ms.Bertin requested that she send a telegram to the
                    Senate JudiciaryCommittee. Ms. Bertin then prepared the text of the telegram forMs. Riggs and
                    Ms.Riggs sent the telegram from Harrisville, WestVirginia, rather than Parrisville, but she actually
                    lives in WestVirginia.She does agree with the statement as prepared by her attorneyand Ms. Bertin
                    advised Ms. Riggs that she would not be contactedby anyone else concerning the matter. However, she
                    stated—thatis, Ms. Riggs stated—that she has already received calls from thepress. She does not know
                    whether anyone had contacted Ms. Bertinwho requested that the telegram be sent.Well, I think that is
                    offensive conduct for a lawyer. It was calledin my day, solicitation. It is an example of the ends
                    pursued and Ithink such activity is not attractive.So I want to get that in the record, Mr.
                    Chairman, and thankyou, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                    You will have all the lists by Saturday.Part of the problem is juggling witnesses, not knowing when
                    wewould end here. But you will have it in plenty of time, I assureyou. And I further assure you that

                    testifyingagainst and then no one testifying for. I have not quite worked itall out yet but it will
                    be worked out tomorrow. If there is an antitrustpanel for, there will be an antitrust panel against.
                    If thereare professors for, there will be professors against.I promise you it will work out that
                    way. I just do not have thelist yet.Now, we will have one more deviation which will be helpful.
                    Youneed not answer any more questions tonight, but rather than takehis 3 minutes to close tomorrow,
                    Senator Thurmond is going totake those 3 minutes to close this evening and then we will
                    begintomorrow as we had indicated.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. Chairman, we had all felt that the Judge would
                    complete histestimony today and since I have moved my family back to SouthCarolina now, I had
                    planned a commitment with them tomorrow,and since Senator Hatch, the ranking member next to me, is
                    hereand will be here tomorrow, I am going to ask him to take the hearing.I feel that I should keep
                    this commitment with my family sincethere are others here that can carry on this work, and I wanted
                    tomake a brief statement this evening before Judge Bork leaves.Judge Bork, as you conclude your
                    testimony tomorrow, Saturday,before the committee, I want to make a few comments at this time.In my
                    33 years in the Senate I cannot recall a nominee who hasbeen more open, more frank, and more
                    effective. Judge Bork, yourintellectual power, your honesty and your courage have left an
                    indelibleimprint on this committee. Never before has a nominee tothe Supreme Court, or any other
                    court, for that matter, subjectedhimself to such an intense, probing examination.Speaking of
                    examinations, several comments have been madeabout how the committee has turned the table on you as
                    a formerlaw professor so that now you had to answer questions and be examined.Well that being the
                    case, permit me to grade you. I wouldlike to indicate that you have passed with honors and with
                    honor. Igrade you A-plus.I also believe that you and those who have watched these
                    proceedingsunderstand what we in Congress as public officials havelong known—it is easy for an
                    opponent or a critic to make chargesand accusations but it is often a laborious process to
                    methodicallydisprove those charges.However, your testimony has shown us again what we all know,and
                    that is, when enough light is cast on a situation and all thefacts are known, truth eventually
                    triumphs. If I may borrow aphrase we have heard before, your testimony has vacated, hasmade null and
                    void charges that you are an ideologue, that you areanti-civil rights, that you do not support the
                    first amendment, andother issues discussed here.Perhaps some people do not agree with your
                    philosophy. That isfair and accepted in America. But philosophy should not be theonly factor in
                    these proceedings. Your testimony across the boardhas indicated that you are indeed qualified to
                    serve with distinctionon the Supreme Court.Judge, I want to compliment you as well as your wife and
                    family,who have been here with you throughout these proceedings. I knowas they leave the hearing
                    room tomorrow that they will take withthem a well-founded pride in you and in your appearance
                    beforethe committee.I want to say that nothing has come put in this testimony thatshows contrary
                    position with the American Bar Association. TheAmerican Bar Association mainly considers three
                    points: Integrity—there has been nothing here to denigrate your integrity;
                    professionalqualifications—there has been nothing to downgrade that;judicial temperament—there has
                    been nothing to downgrade that.You have met every qualification that is considered by the
                    AmericanBar Association. On the matter of philosophy, people differ.We understand that. But as I
                    said, that should only be one factorto be considered.So I just want to compliment you for the way
                    you have handledyourself, for the way your family has stood by you here, and I hopeand pray that you
                    will be confirmed by this committee and by theSenate to be on the Supreme Court. You deserve it, the
                    country deservesit, and good luck and God bless you.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I demure to the football agenda. Thishearing is causing me to miss a
                    part of the Alabama-Florida game.I am going to cut my questioning very short. I think almostevery
                    subject has been fully covered.Many of us have had to miss a good deal of the questioning onthis
                    matter because of action on the floor that required us to bethere—votes and other things. Some of us
                    had to go to other committeemeetings and have been called out for various other things.But every
                    Senator has had staff representatives here, and thereis a transcript being made.This Caucus Room,
                    which I have been in now for many, manymonths with the Iran-Contra hearings and these hearings,
                    hasproblems sometimes with the acoustics. So I am going to read thetranscript to be sure that I have
                    not misunderstood any questionthat may have been asked and then any answer that may havebeen
                    given.There are only a few things I want to go into. One, yesterday Iasked you about your speech.
                    "The Crisis in Constitutional Theory:Back to the Future," to the Philadelphia Society on April 3,
                    1987,which has also been labeled the "Bork wave theory of law reform."You basically said that what
                    you were speaking to there pertainedto the movement, the waves, that would sweep out to sea the
                    debrisof the nonoriginalism philosophy that had prevailed in the Court,was directed to law
                    schools.Well, of course, I think you can look at the speech and come upwith different
                    interpretations, and that is one.Just as a matter of the record, I think that that speech ought tobe
                    made a part of the record, and Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimousconsent that the entire speech be
                    included in the record for interpretationof those who wish to read it.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, I think it is conventional wisdom, and ithas been so held in some
                    cases whose names I cannot now recall,that Congress, since it need not have created the inferior
                    federalcourts, may deprive them of jurisdiction if it wishes—in whichcase, constitutional cases and
                    so forth would start in the Statecourt systems.It has been argued that the exceptions clause of
                    article III wouldallow Congress to take away jurisdiction from the Supreme Courtin whole classes of
                    cases; and as I recall, attempts have been madeto do that in the abortion area, in the school prayer
                    area, and soforth.I have always taken the position that the exceptions clause wasnot designed for
                    that purpose, and therefore cannot be used forthat purpose.It seems to me that had the framers and
                    the ratifiers wanted amechanism to curb a Supreme Court that was doing things theydid not like—and
                    return power to the Congress instead of to thecourts. They would have written a clause that did
                    that.This clause, in fact, if you take away the jurisdiction of the SupremeCourt, everything would
                    go to the State court systems. AndI do not think you can get the constitutional cases out of the
                    Statecourt systems. I do not think you can deprive the State court systemsof constitutional cases,
                    because the Constitution says thatevery State judge shall be bound by this Constitution.Well, there
                    are two reasons, then, why the exceptions clause wasnot intended for use in this fashion. One is
                    that it does not returnpower to the democratic legislatures. The other is that it spreadsthe
                    decision of the issue out into 50 different court systems—thenit would have been 13 different court
                    systems, but the principle isthe same. That means the exceptions clause could not be used inthe most
                    important cases.For example, if a challenge to a draft law were made, and Congresstook away the
                    jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to decide theconstitutionality of a draft law, you would have 50
                    different systemsdeciding that. And you cannot have a system in which thedraft is constitutional in
                    Ohio and unconstitutional in Indiana, andso forth across the country.All these reasons lead me to
                    believe that that clause was neverintended as a way of checking the Supreme Court when
                    Congressthinks it has created an excess. So I think it is really a housekeep-ing clause, a clause to
                    be used for making court jurisdiction moreefficient, and making things run better—not a checking
                    device.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Yes, during the Reconstruction Era. And he petitionedfor certiorari, and as
                    I recall—not certiorari—a petition forhabeas corpus, as you said, Senator—and I think the
                    SupremeCourt had actually heard argument in the case when Congress removedits jurisdiction over that
                    kind of habeas corpus. And theCourt held that it was without jurisdiction.Now, later, I think the
                    Court has said that there were otherwrits of habeas corpus that could be used so that Congress had
                    notreally effectively prevented the Court from hearing that kind ofissue; it just took that
                    particular case away. And then following ExParte McCardle, there was U.S. v. Klein, another somewhat
                    ambiguousprecedent, and they do not even cite Ex Parte McCardle inU.S. v. Klein. But that was a case
                    in which Congress—I guess theCourt of Claims or some court had ruled that if a Confederatewhose
                    property had been seized received a pardon, he could get thevalue of his property back—and Congress
                    passed a statute sayingthat acceptance of a pardon was proof of guilt, and therefore youcould not
                    get your property back. And the Supreme Court said, as Irecall, two things. One was that that denied
                    the President's powerto pardon, turned it into a condemnation rather than a pardon,and Congress
                    could not constitutionally do that; and also that itprescribed a rule of decision for the courts,
                    which Congress alsocould not do in a constitutional case.Now, I do not know what the upshot of Klein
                    and McCardle togetheris—and then, of course, there was Glidden v. Zdanok, amore recent case, in
                    which I think it was Justice Harlan who referredto something about McCardle as the law, and Justice
                    Douglas,in either a concurrence or a dissent, said he did not think amajority of today's Court would
                    approve McCardle.So I do not really know where the matter lies as a matter ofprecedent or stare
                    decisis; I think it is somewhat confused.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">The Senator from Pennsylvania, SenatorSpecter.Senator SPECTER, Thank you
                    very much, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, yesterday, before my time ran out, you and I weretalking about
                    the subject of judicial review and the finality of SupremeCourt decisions and the importance of
                    having the SupremeCourt as the final arbiter of constitutional issues.You have spoken about this
                    subject on a few occasions, and Iwould like to pursue the matter with what you have said on
                    thoseoccasions.At a speech before the American Jewish Committee back on May14th of 1982, you said
                    that: "Judicial enforcement of the Constitutionis a powerful national tradition"—this appears on
                    page 7. "Itis thinkable that we need never have developed that tradition andthat we would be as free
                    as we are, as free as other Western nationswhose judges never acquired the power ours have
                    acquired."Then you go on to say that tradition and history make weightyclaims, and we should not
                    abandon it lightly. But the thrust ofwhat you have said there is that it would be thinkable not to
                    havejudicial review.And in two later speeches, one at UCLA on April 24th of 1985,you said, in
                    considering the issue of interpretivism of originalintent—and the term "interpretivism" means
                    original intent asyou use it, and "noninterpretivism," judges who do not go for originalintent. You
                    say, "The choice before us therefore is clear. It isnot a choice between interpretivism and
                    noninterpretivism, butrather, between interpretivism and the abandonment of judicialreview under the
                    Constitution."And then you made a similar statement in 1987 on June 12th, atthe American Studies
                    Center, where you said: "But the more importantpoint is that if originalism or interpretivism is
                    impossible,then there can be no legitimacy to judicial review."Now, my question is, if it is
                    thinkable that we could proceed inthis country without judicial review, and it is impossible not
                    tohave a doctrine where judges rely upon original intent, do youthink that we have to abandon
                    judicial review?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, there is simply no possibility of anybodyabandoning judicial review
                    at this stage in our history. It is an absolutelyfirmly-rooted tradition in our law, and it is
                    justified by theway—you know, the First Congress that wrote the Judiciary Act of1789 gave the
                    Supreme Court jurisdiction when State courts ruleda federal statute unconstitutional under the
                    Federal Constitution.That pretty clearly indicates to me that the people who knewmost about the
                    Constitution—that is the First Congress, who knewa great deal about it—intended judicial review,
                    because they didnot tell the Supreme Court that it had to reverse any State courtjudgment holding a
                    Federal statute unconstitutional under theFederal Constitution, nor did they say that State courts
                    could notreview constitutionality.So that—I want to come along to my speeches here for amoment—so
                    that I think judicial review was intended from the beginning,and for that reason alone, I would not
                    abandon it.Now, the talk before the American Jewish Committee—when Isaid it is thinkable we need not
                    have started with judicial review,all I meant by that is we have other democratic free societies
                    likeEngland, France and so forth, which have a long history of freedomwithout judicial review. We
                    have it. We are not going to give it up.Nobody is going to cut back on it.At the UCLA talk, I was
                    meeting the charge of people who saythat, oh, discerning anything called an original understanding
                    ofthe Constitution is impossible.Well, if it is impossible to know what the Constitution means,then
                    I do not know where judges get their power to override democraticdecisions, because I have always
                    thought that it is thejudge's job to interpret the law and not to make it; and if youcannot
                    understand the Constitution—which I think is a ridiculousclaim; I think you can understand the
                    Constitution—but if youcould not, then I do not know what would authorize a judge tomake law. That
                    is all I was saying.</p>

                    no idea, then I donot know what he applies. And if his job is to interpret the law andnot to make

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, when I say original intent—I understand, youare making a good point,
                    Senator—but when I say original intent,what I mean is really original understanding, because law is
                    apublic act, and it is really what was understood generally at thetime the Constitution was framed,
                    not the subjective intentions ofJames Madison.And when I say original understanding, when I sit down
                    andlook at the Bill of Rights, and it says "freedom of the press," rightaway, I know what they are
                    driving at. I may not know exactlywhat they mean, but I know what they are driving at. I know
                    thecentral freedom, or the core of the freedom, that they are drivingat. When they say "no
                    unreasonable searches or seizures," not onlyfrom the language but from the history of the British
                    and the waythey behaved in this country with their searches and seizures andgeneral warrants, I know
                    what they are driving at.So I do not think there is any difficulty in understanding thebasic
                    principles of the powers granted to Congress or of the free818doms preserved in the Bill of Rights
                    and the Civil War Amendments.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, Judge Bork, this theme has run throughthe hearing and I think is a
                    central theme, and I think there issome difference of opinion as to whether you can really find
                    originalintent, whether the tradition of U.S. constitutional interpretationlooks to specific
                    constitutional rights as, for example, privacy,which we have talked about so often, or whether in a
                    more generalizedcontext, Justices who advocate restraint, like Frankfurter, talkabout values rooted
                    in the conscience and tradition of the people,and that the history of U.S. constitutional
                    jurisprudence, as I see it,has in many, many cases not been grounded on original intent—sometimes,
                    yes, but frequently not.And it would be my thought that as the Court goes forward, andthat if you
                    are confirmed, that there would be more flexibility inthe application of constitutional law. And I
                    look to your own writingson the question of whether you can really find original intent.In 1968, in
                    the article that you have referred to a number oftimes in Fortune Magazine, where you set forth a
                    theory of constitutionallaw, you had written this at page 141: "The text of theConstitution, as
                    anyone experienced with words might expect, isleast precise where it is the most important. Like the
                    Ten Commandments,the Constitution enshrines profound values, but necessarilyomits the minor premises
                    required to apply them."So that, from that statement, it seems to me a fair reading isthat it is
                    pretty hard to find intent of the framers.Then, you go on on the same page: "History can be of
                    considerablehelp, but it tells much too little about the specific intentions ofthe men who framed,
                    adopted and ratified the great clauses. Therecord is incomplete. The men involved often had vague or
                    evenconflicting intentions."In the often-quoted Indiana Law Review article, you talk at page22 about
                    the first amendment, and you say: "The framers seemedto have no coherent theory of free speech."
                    Then, you say: "Thefirst amendment, like the rest of the Bill of Rights, appears to havebeen a
                    hastily-drafted document upon which little thought was extended."Then, at page 26, you say: "The
                    framers of the first amendmentprobably had no clear view of that proposition."And in your later
                    speeches, you discuss repetitively the questionabout it is really the ratifiers as opposed to the
                    framers and theconflicting views.Now, in that context, where I think you are exactly right inwhat
                    you have written and said, because of the great difficulty offinding intent, how much validity is
                    there in searching for originalintent as a necessary prerequisite for a constitutional
                    decision,without which the Court has no legitimacy?</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I think that is right, Senator; there is a lot ofdifficulty. But let
                    me discuss this. Unlike the Ten Commandments,the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and the
                    Commandmentshave a similar—the Bill of Rights and the Ten Commandmentshave a similar generality, but
                    we are closer in history, and we havea lot of evidence about the Bill of Rights now.The remark I
                    made in Indiana, which you have just quoted, Itook from Leonard Levy's book on the first amendment.
                    That bookis now about 30 years old; I think he has found further evidence,and other people have
                    found further evidence since then.But we do have, in the case of the Constitution—I referred to
                    thefact that we cannot know the framers' specific intentions; I thinkyou read that in one of those
                    pieces, that we cannot know theirspecific intentions, and indeed we cannot. And indeed, their
                    specificintentions would not help us a great deal because our task is toapply their public
                    understanding of what they were protecting tomodern circumstances as to which they could have no
                    specific intentions.But when I talk about the original understanding, what a judgeneeds from the
                    Constitution is a major premise—what is it he issupposed to protect—and then he has to protect
                    it.Now, we have the text. For example, the first amendment tellsus that it deals with religion, no
                    establishment, free exercise. Rightaway we know that we are in an area, so that we know it is
                    notjust a free-floating liberty; we know what they are talking about.They are talking about not
                    establishing religion, and they are talkingabout free exercise of religion.Then they say Congress
                    shall make no law abridging the freedomof speech or of the press. So I know now that I am talking
                    aboutspeech and press, and the freedom of those two, so I know that Iam not talking about a
                    generalized liberty; I am talking about afreedom of the press.Now, when you want to flesh that out,
                    for example, you have alot of contemporary debate about what was going on. You have, inthe case of
                    the main body of the Constitution, the FederalistPapers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, and many
                    debates. In the caseof the Bill of Rights, we are a little short on debates in Congress,but you have
                    some contemporary discussion; you have actions bythe early Congresses which shows what they
                    understood themselvesto have proposed; and you have actions by the early courts,which show what they
                    understood to have been done, and some ofthose courts for people who were at the convention or at
                    variousratifying conventions.And then you have, for example, in the case of the free speechclause,
                    or the free press clause, episodes of early history, such asthe passage of the Alien and Sedition
                    Acts and the terrible controversythat raged around those, so that we now understand that theAlien
                    and Sedition Acts were in fact unconstitutional statutes,which, in all this way, we begin to get a
                    principle whose contoursare not clearcut. That is granted. But at least we understand thebasic
                    freedom they wanted to preserve.Now, judges who look for original understanding and look at thesame
                    evidence and think as hard as they can will, in the borderlinecases, often come out differently. I
                    do not mean to say that originalunderstanding gives anybody a mechanical way to approach a
                    problem.It does not; but it gives them a pretty firm starting point.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, as you define it, it does not seemto me that original intent
                    provides any more specificity than theFrankfurter definition or the Cardozo definition of rooted in
                    thetradition and history of our society.When you talk about fundamental values—and you have
                    writtenon surveillance and electronic surveillance, which the FoundingFathers could not have
                    anticipated; similarly, they could not haveanticipated birth control devices. You talk about the
                    concept of privacy,it runs through the Constitution, in a number of amendmentsas you described them
                    yesterday. Why is the doctrine of originalintent sacrosanct in terms of the great difficulty of
                    applying it withspecificity, as you say—because you point out that their specificintent is not
                    clearcut.Does that definition really advance the definition of constitutionalvalues more so than

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">Well, Senator, you are making a very powerful argumentfrom a very strong
                    tradition. I hope—I think what I amsaying also comes from a very strong tradition in our
                    constitutionallaw, going back to Joseph Story and the first Marshall Court.Let me say this. If the
                    concept of ordered liberty, which Cardozoand others used, turned out to be a continuing tradition on
                    the SupremeCourt—and I do not know where it stands now—and if ithad a defined category so that
                    judges were not free to make law atwill, then I would not have so much difficulty with it.But as you
                    know, Justice Black, who objected strongly to what hecalled the natural law/due process version of
                    making law, in factincorporated, tried to get and succeeded, various parts of the Bill ofRights, now
                    almost all of the Bill of Rights, incorporated againstthe States through the 14th amendment, and in
                    large part hismotive for doing that, as he said, was to prevent judges from roamingat will. He
                    thought if you could incorporate the Bill of Rightsagainst the States, then judges would apply the
                    prohibition to theBill of Rights and secure liberty, but they would not use this whathe called
                    natural law method of making up rights.And on that point, Senator, reasonable men can differ. Strong
                    argumentscan be made on both sides. I adhere to my view that Iwant judges to be confined by the law,
                    not make it up. There areothers who disagree with that, but as I said, I believe in interpretingit,
                    not creating it.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, Judge Bork, it is true that the specificprovisions of the Bill of
                    Rights were taken into the due processclause of the 14th amendment. But that was not the sole basis
                    usedby the Court. And before the Court came to the incorporation doctrine,there were many wrangles.
                    And the first time the SupremeCourt interfered, or took jurisdiction of and changed, a State
                    criminalproceeding was the very famous case of Brown v. Mississippi.And if you read through that
                    case, a 1936 opinion of the SupremeCourt of the United States, it is an abject horror story—and I
                    amnot going to go through the facts. Sufficient to quote Chief JusticesHughes' characterization of
                    it as a medieval account as to whatwas done to the black defendant in that case by the law
                    enforcementauthorities of Mississippi.And the Court then, for the first time, strikes down a
                    Statecriminal conviction on the ground that it offends principles of justicerooted in the tradition
                    and conscience of our people, so as to beranked as fundamental. And that got it started.And then
                    Justice Black comes along in the case of Ashcraft v.Tennessee, which involves really grilling. And
                    as I was rethinkingAshcraft v. Tennessee, I thought you might have standing, JudgeBork, to object to
                    what has been going on here. Ashcraft was questionedfor 36 hours by half a dozen law enforcement
                    officials. Youhave been questioned for longer than that, by more.But Ashcraft is a Black opinion,
                    and it is pretty hard sometimesto separate procedural due process from substantive due process.And
                    Black strikes down the conviction on grounds of an involuntaryconfession.But perhaps it is
                    sufficient, Judge Bork, if you say that the argumentis a powerful argument from strong tradition,
                    because part ofour process here, in our checks and balance system—this is theonly time that anyone
                    gets to talk to a potential Supreme Courtnominee or to a federal judge, and it is a great thing in

                    And this is, I think, part of the beauty ofthe system of checks and balances.I had the occasion on
                    Thursday, day before yesterday, to join thePresident in going to Philadelphia and then to come back
                    here inthe afternoon and participate in this proceeding, and the Presidenthad some very good things
                    to say about you, Judge Bork. And it isthe beauty of the system where the Court has the last word,
                    andthe President makes the appointments, and you have to clear theSenate. So this is an experience
                    which is a very unique one.You and I were talking a few moments ago, and I think that thiswill set a
                    pattern for the future, and a very good one, for the benefitof the country, because this is a very
                    different confirmation proceedingthan we had last year with Justice Rehnquist for Chief andfor Judge
                    Scalia for Justice and for Justice O'Connor in 1981.Many people do not realize that these
                    proceedings where nomineesappear before Senators are of relatively recent duration, startingwith
                    Justice Frankfurter.But we have gone farther in this line, I think, than at any timein the past. And
                    it may be that there will be some imprint on yourthinking if you are confirmed about what may be a
                    strong argument—a powerful argument, as you put—from a strong tradition.That is part of what the
                    process is and what I would hope would beaccomplished.And when I look at the question of original
                    intent, I think it isfine in some cases where you can find it, and I think if you canfind it, you
                    ought to apply it. But I think so much of the time youcannot find it, and that you ought not be
                    hidebound by it, and thatFrankfurter is right when he talks about the contours of the lawbeing
                    reasonably specific and not really subjective, and you do nothave to have an articulation of privacy
                    to find it as a fundamentalright in the Constitution to apply it, if the facts of the case requireit
                    in accordance with the needs of the Nation, which is your languagefrom a few days ago as you talked
                    about the commerceclause.</p>

                    intent, there is a very interesting commentby Justice Scalia in the case of Edwards y. Aguilar,
                    where hesays at page 27 of the opinion—and he is talking about legislativeintent—"Discerning the
                    subjective motivation of those enacting thestatute is, to be honest, almost always an impossible
                    task." Goingon to page 28, he says, "To look for the sole purpose of even asingle legislator is
                    probably to look for something that does notexist."And legislative intent in the statutes is very
                    much akin to originalintent of the drafters or of the ratifiers, and I am sure thatevery one of my
                    colleagues here today would agree that if you seeklegislative intent, it is nebulous and really
                    nonexistent as you tryto carve it out for an entire body of 100 Senators or 435 Congressmen.So the
                    question arises to what extent can you really bottom youropinions on what the Congress intended.</p>

                    mean, large bodies simply do not reason coherentlytogether. There are just too many people to sit
                    down anddraft a detailed antitrust law according to the teachings of microeconomics.Where it leaves
                    me, Senator, is this. The antitrust laws are remarkablestatutes, and as the Supreme Court has said,
                    they havethe generality of provisions of the Constitution.The Sherman Act,according to John Sherman,
                    the Senator whose Act it really wasand who did most of the explanation of it, he gave examples
                    ofthings that were to be illegal, and he said for the rest, it was left tothe courts to evolve—to
                    protect competition from case to case, asthey saw it, as they understood the facts and the
                    competition.The later antitrust statutes, the Clayton Act in particular, directsthe courts to deal
                    with certain kinds of events—mergers andso forth—which may tend toward monopoly or tend toward a

                    what preserves competition and whatharms competition. And that is the kind of principle that
                    Congressis perfectly capable of thinking of and enacting, and leaving it tothe courts to protect
                    competition.</p>

                    different point. There are—and this goes backto the main theme of my view of judging—there are
                    commentatorsin the field of antitrust who want courts, through the antitrustlaws, to impose or
                    implement multiple values, often having nothingto do with competition. And I was making the
                    point—and thenthey point to somebody who said in the legislative history of theClayton Act, Section
                    7, who talked about the fact that where youhave big business, you have more smog and a higher lung
                    cancerrate, or something of that sort—and I was ridiculing the idea thata judge should take that and
                    start measuring smog and lungcancer rates to decide whether or not a merger was legal, becausethe
                    statute—a judge cannot—that is just a complete delegation tothe judge to make any social policy.What
                    a judge can do is look atthe words of the statute, which say competition and monopoly; promoteone,
                    avoid the other.</p>

                    shared with much of that regulation, notably the NationalIndustrial Recovery Act, the premise that

                    "Last week, at a day-long workshopsponsored by the Conference Board, a business research
                    organization,Judge Bork, who sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia, made it
                    plain that he felt free to apply hiseconomic theories, whatever the law says. Take his view on
                    theRobinson-Patman Act, which prohibits price discrimination." Andthere is a quote here, presumably
                    your statement. " 'If the new eco826nomics is right, there is never a case in which price
                    discriminationinjures competition,' Judge Bork said. In the Robinson-PatmanAct, when Congress said
                    it wanted to forbid price discrimination toprotect competition, they said it with a wink. I do not
                    think it is ajudge's job to enforce winks.' "I think the first question must be: Did you say that?

                <p class="short_transcript">"TO the Editor: The reporting of my remarks at theConference Board seriously
                    misrepresents my views of my obligationas a Judge. I most definitely did not make it 'plain that I
                    feltfree to apply my economic theories whatever the antitrust lawsays.' I stated emphatically that
                    as a lower court judge, I have anabsolute duty to follow the law as laid down by the Supreme
                    Court.At most, a lower court judge can give us reasons for doubting theusefulness of a rule. That
                    practice is both common and beneficial* * *," and so forth.And I do not want to read the whole
                    letter, because it goes on fora while, but I will provide you that, too.But the reference to the
                    "wink" is one I have made before, andthe reason I said that—and I think I said it in the book—I
                    wasonce discussing what struck me as a peculiarly outrageous Robinson-Patman Act decision by the
                    Supreme Court in which they ineffect made competition impossible in a local market—and a
                    decisionthat everybody has criticized. And I was discussing it with ayoung man who had just left a
                    clerkship on the Supreme Court,and he said, oh, the Justice thinks sure, the Act says
                    competition,but Congress passed it with a wink; they did not mean competition,they meant protect
                    competitors—protect people from competition.Well, I thought that was a terrible judicial role. I
                    think you donot enforce a congressional "wink" because Congress should passits statutes so the
                    people know what is being passed</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I have seen some of your writings onthat, and perhaps we will have
                    time to get to it. It is a fascinatingfield.Judge Bork, I do not disagree with your interpretation
                    of antitrustlaw, and I do not intend to pursue it any further. The limitedpoint that I seek to make
                    here on the references to the antitrustlaws is the difficulty of finding congressional intent and
                    the widerange of judicial discretion which necessarily applies, and the practicaleffect of a judge's
                    role is to apply that discretion and not to beable to really find what legislators' intend, and to
                    try and makesome sense out of what a judge may conclude to be a perniciouslaw, and to try to make
                    some sense out of conflicting legislators'statements in the Congressional Record; and that a judge's
                    rolegoes much beyond interstitial legislation, as the term is used, toreally try to pull the whole
                    picture together; and that that is thetradition of the law, and I think appropriately so. And I
                    think yourantitrust writings make a lot of sense, and I think that that iswhat judges have to do.But
                    I do think that as you apply that beyond the antitrust field,into other legislative lines and into
                    constitutional lines, there is abroader traditional role of the judge in applying values to theneeds
                    of the nation against, again, your word, beyond what you canfind in some specific intent.So let me
                    move on to the subject of federalism, which you havewritten about extensively and spoken about. This
                    involves the questionof federalism as it relates to a more central topic which hasbeen a very
                    important one in these hearings, and that is yourstatement that the time has passed for upsetting
                    certain constitutionaldoctrines, which are too deeply embedded in the fabric of theNation to change
                    those doctrines.I think that is a very important point, Judge Bork, because it relatesto your own
                    interpretation of original intent, and on somelines, where you think that even though original
                    intent was followed,as you gave the example of the commerce clause, it is toolate, and it is part of
                    your judicial philosophy which you articulateon stare decisis, which may apply to other cases, and
                    you enumerateda string of values and criteria which would not upset establishedcases, trying to give
                    some regard for expectation, stability inthe law, and so forth, as you have testified to.A statement
                    that you made in a speech in 1986, last year, raisessome question about that, and I just want to ask
                    you that. This is aspeech on federalism which was delivered at the Attorney General'sConference in
                    Williamsburg January 14th to 26th, 1986, and Iam referring now to page 10. You say this: "The
                    protection of federalismfrom national legislative powers is more difficult. Thereare so many laws on
                    the books, so many Supreme Court decisionsupholding them, and the federal government is involved in
                    somany areas, that a new, sharp-edged definition of national powers,such as commerce, taxing and
                    spending, would create chaos politically,economically and socially." And I will leave some out
                    here—it does not apply to the meaning.Then you go on to say: "Dees it mean that we must give up
                    judicialprotection of federalism? It was this thought that for a timeled me to think that we had
                    passed the point of no return. I am nolonger so sure, though. I am no longer so sure. So what I am
                    aboutto say is to be understood as tentative and indeed, speculative."Then I omit some material,
                    again not germane.Then you say: "If federalism is to receive judicial protection, Ithink courts will
                    have to admit that bright line tests are unavailable;that prior cases are irreconcilable, and that
                    decisions willturn on such matters as the degree of federal intrusiveness and thevitality of States
                    as policymakers." Then I leave some out."Would this be unacceptable judicial activism? Perhaps
                    not.There is nothing wrong with judges being active in the defense ofreal constitutional
                    principles." Close quotes.Now, my question is this. If you go to rockbed, as you articulateit, in
                    the commerce power—and you have written about this repetitively—and if you are not so sure last year
                    that you may not beable to revitalize judicial activism which, as you say, is appropriate,and I
                    agree with you, in defense of the Constitution and articulationof constitutional principles, my
                    questions are, first, do you believethat it is now not too late to revive the questions on the
                    commerceclause and federalism? And, if it is not too late there, perhapsit is not too late anywhere,
                    in any of the cases, to go back,take another look, and change the Court interpretations of
                    theConstitution.</p>

                    commerce clause decisions. And the sentence,right after you say, "The decisions will turn on such
                    mattersas the degree of federal intrusiveness and the vitality of States aspolicymakers, perhaps a
                    presumption can be established againstfederal invasions of areas traditionally reserved to the
                    States,"what I was thinking about is, you know, we have not yet said thatthe commerce clause could
                    be used to enact a national law of divorce,or to enact—maybe it can—but there are certain
                    local,moral matters—divorce, marriage and so forth—that it has beentraditionally thought simply was
                    not the business of the federalgovernment.Now, that would be a considerable extension of anywhere
                    thatCongress has gone yet with the commerce clause. And as I said,this was tentative, but it may be
                    that there are some local mattersso traditionally reserved to the States that the commerce
                    clauseshould not go there.But I had no intention of rolling anything back that has beendone.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, I now want to move to the questionof the executive/legislative
                    conflict. This is a subject that SenatorByrd questioned you about extensively yesterday, and I had
                    intendedto ask you about Barnes v. Kline and the consideration thatwe ought to renounce outright the
                    whole notion of congressionalstanding, but that has been done in some detail, so I will move on.But
                    at the outset, I want to raise a question that troubles me asto the appropriate degree of deference
                    which the Senate shouldgive to a Presidential nominee. And this is a matter, like
                    judicialphilosophy, which is widely debated. And as I said in my openingstatement, you had made the
                    comment to me when we sat downearly on that you thought judicial philosophy was appropriate
                    fordiscussion, and you have certainly proved it in the course of thepast five days.There has been a
                    general thought that there is a certain deferenceowed to the President under our advise and consent
                    function,and of course, each Senator has to decide for himself as to whatthat means. And a little
                    different consideration has crossed mymind on the advise and consent function as it relates to
                    legislative/executive conflicts, because here we are—the President nominates,the Senate confirms,
                    and if the Court, and if the judicial nomineehas a position which is likely to upset the balance
                    between article Ipowers, the Congress—we still are article I—and article II powers,the executive,
                    then perhaps that kind of deference, if any exists, isnot owed. And that is a theoretical issue
                    which I have not foundany writing on.I would invite any observation you would care to make, but
                    Iwould understand if you would not care to make an observation,because it may really be a question
                    solely for the Senate. But if youcare to make an observation, I would be pleased to hear it.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">YOU can have my copy. It is very short. All ofthese deep issues are
                    expressed in very brief terms.In the Wall Street Journal, March 9, 1978: "As expiation forVietnam,
                    we have the War Powers resolution, an attempt by Congressto share in detail decisions about the
                    deployment of U.S.armed forces in the world. It is probably unconstitutional, and
                    certainlyunworkable."Now, this is an issue which we do not care very much about. Ithas not been on
                    the Senate floor since yesterday afternoon, and wetook up the question as to whether the War Powers
                    Act was applicableto the Persian Gulf situation. I voted that it was, and I feelvery strongly about
                    the limits of executive authority and of balance.In 1984, there was an effort made to frame a test
                    for constitutionalityof the War Powers Act. Senator Baker participated in it; Iwent to the trouble
                    of drafting a complaint—I had not done thatfor a while. And we talked to the Department of Justice
                    aboutframing a case. And the standing issue, we think we can get by bylegislation; the case in
                    controversy, we are not so sure about. Youfellows, the Court, you fellows, if confirmed, have the
                    final word onthat.But there is a real hot argument about the War Powers Act, asto whether it is
                    constitutional or not. It says if U.S. personnel arein imminent hostilities, danger of hostilities,
                    then the Presidenthas to report to Congress, and there are a whole series of proceduresto be
                    followed because the Congress has the authority to declarewar, and it has been taken over by the
                    executive branch.In 1984, we had extensive debates on the subject, and I askedSenator Percy, who was
                    managing the administration's bill, aboutwhether Korea was a war, and he said yes, it was; and was
                    Vietnama war, yes, it was. And Congress did not declare war, and theCongress came back with the War
                    Powers Act, and the Presidenthas made submissions choosing a form of language not to
                    recognizeconstitutionality.Now, as to the issue of standing, isn't the Congress entitled tohave the
                    Court make a decision where the President ignores theAct? We may be right, and we may be wrong. But
                    take the standingquestion first. Why shouldn't we have a right to have the ArticleIII Branch, the
                    Supreme Court, decide the case?</p>

                    today. Whenthe President acts in Lebanon, in Grenada, in the Persian Gulf, thereality is that the
                    day of Congress declaring war is gone.On the spending issue, the reality there again is that
                    Congresslacks the power, because once the President has dispatched a fleetto the Persian Gulf, it is
                    unthinkable and impossible for the Congressnot to fund that operation.If we do not have authority
                    under the War Powers Act to requirea certain Presidential response and then to say no to the
                    President,where does the Congress in 1987 exercise its congressional authorityto declare war?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I assume the Congress would.But anyway, let me go on to the War Powers
                    Act, because I wasleading into a somewhat different point. I was merely saying thatthe ultimate
                    question should be for Congress, about hostilities andwar and so forth, but there are tactical
                    decisions to be made.To take an example which I have given before, I think Congresscould have told
                    the President to shut down World War II, clearly.But I think if Congress had told him he had to
                    surrender the air833borne troops at Bastonne, I think that is a decision for the President,not for
                    the Congress. That is a tactical decision, and he is theCommander-in-Chief.Now, my only thing about
                    the War Powers Act—aside from thelegislative veto aspect, which I do not know about anymore—itmay be
                    that if it leads to micro-management of tactical decisions ina conflict by Congress, then I think
                    there is a constitutional problem.Now, maybe it can be interpreted so that that problem neverarises.
                    I do not know. But that is all I meant in this brief one sentenceas I was leading into something
                    else.</p>

                    you characterize it.You say: "I think there is no reason to doubt that PresidentNixon had ample

                    take the question if independent counsel, which is a bigissue right now, for all the reasons that
                    you know. And your testimonyback before the 93d Congress, as it appears on page 450 ofhearings
                    before the Judiciary Committee, you say that the establishmentof a Special Prosecutor outside the

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, let me talk about that, Senator. I thought thatwas true. Of course,
                    the statutes involved there were very differentfrom the statute we are operating under now—which I
                    have notlooked at particularly, but I know it is very different. And what Isaid was that a Special
                    Prosecutor outside the executive branchwould be—I think it would be. I think that thing—those bills
                    I wastalking about, I think, contemplated courts appointing, controllingand removing Special
                    Prosecutors, which I thought was not a Judicialfunction at all.Now, I think I also testified,
                    Senator, that in terms of congressionalprotection of a Special Prosecutor, it would be hard for
                    Congressto protect him if he was an official nominated by and confirmedby the Senate, because the
                    President's power over such officialsis at a maximum. But I think I also testified that
                    probablyCongress could protect a Special Prosecutor by statute so that hecould only be fired for
                    cause, if he was a subordinate officer appointedby a department head.So I did not say you could not
                    have a Special Prosecutor. I justsaid under certain circumstances it would be difficult.But may I—I
                    want to say that the impression that I always ruleor side with the President is wrong. I have
                    discussed at length, Ithink, the episode that led me to tell the Attorney General that Iwould not
                    argue a pocket veto case, and that I filed a 12-page—or8-page or whatever—analysis with the Attorney
                    General, and heforwarded it to the President, and we got President Ford to say hewould not use a
                    pocket veto when Congress had left somebodythere during an adjournment or a recess to receive a
                    return veto.But also, I sat on a case in my court, the City of New Havencase, in which the President
                    was claiming the power to impoundfunds, and that power to impound was in the statute, but alsothere
                    was a congressional veto. I voted with the majority that sincethe congressional veto that Congress
                    had was invalidated byChadha, the President's power to impound was lost, because theCongress would
                    never have given the President the power to impoundif it had not had a legislative veto. So I voted
                    with Congressand against the President on that one.My record is not one of unvarying support for the
                    executivebranch.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.Judge Bork, when we broke for the short
                    recess we were talkingabout the issue of executive and legislative authority and just
                    anotherquestion or two on that subject.You wrote about the subject of reforming foreign
                    intelligence—again going back to the Wall Street Journal—and you commentedabout the bill, the
                    Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, where theCongress was seeking to impose certain restraints
                    upon executiveauthority. You referred to the congressional action as a,
                    "certainlightheadedness.''The issue is likely to come up soon on the matter of cover
                    intelligencewhere the Intelligence Committee is trying to work out acharter with the executive
                    authority on what is timely notification,a subject which was of very much concern in the recent
                    Iran/Contra hearings and some of us think really led to the execution ofthe sale of arms to Iran
                    because there had not been notification tothe Congress, and had there been oversight it would have
                    beenstopped.Recently, the President wrote to the Intelligence Committee—and this is just within the
                    past few weeks—saying that there wouldbe new procedures; except in the most exceptional
                    circumstancestimely notification will be given within two working days.I am sure there is going to
                    be a controversy as to what are exceptionalcircumstances and I for one believe that this kind of a
                    commitmenthas relatively little value because it leaves it up to the executiveto decide what are
                    exceptional circumstances. What I amlooking for is the reassurance that if you are confirmed and if
                    anyof these cases get to the Supreme Court through the "standingmorass" issue, that as an Article
                    III Justice you will give us a fairshake.I do not know how to articulate it any more directly than
                    that.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I raise the question because of the writingswhich you have done but I
                    think that these hearings are agood occasion to focus for just a moment or two in our process
                    ofchecks and balances to give you at least this Senator's view of theimportance of having the Court
                    make an ultimate decision in someof these areas.I am not proposing that all of these are susceptible
                    to judicial decisionand I understand the political process and the tug of warand I believe that that
                    has a lot of applicability but I would restatewhat Senator Byrd had articulated yesterday about the
                    necessity insome situations, short of missiles being in the air, for the SupremeCourt of the United
                    States to take these cases, and if the Congressand executive are irretrievably at loggerheads, for
                    you to make thedecision.Judge Bork, now I would like to move on to the philosophicalarea that you
                    have written about and talked about a great deal,and that is egalitarianism. I think it is very
                    relevant on an understandingas to where you were heading on the equal protectionclause of the 14th
                    amendment in terms of application. You havequestioned the desirability, as I read your writings on
                    an egalitariansociety. And one of your statements I would like your commentabout, the speech at
                    Carlton College.You designated—and the materials provided us is 1977 or 1978—and at page 7 you say
                    the following:Though it is obviously false, the trend of legislation continues to place
                    increasingburdens upon business in the name of a wide variety of social ends, heavily freightedwith
                    the goal of redistribution, environmentalism, consumerism, energy control,racial equality, safety
                    and health, investor protection, small business welfare and soon. Though each of these has much to
                    be said for it, each has been over done andthe costs are making business much less productive than
                    before.Now, you have handed down opinions on the environmental protectionarea to the contrary as to
                    what you have generalized abouthere.</p>

                    itself, but inthe aggregate you may conceivably hamper business efficiency sufficientlythat nobody
                    will be better off because we will be a poorernation.I think I had just seen a study by the dean of
                    the business schoolwhich traced the decline in real constant dollars of shares of corporations—that
                    is, the Dow Jones Index should now be at around4,000 or 5,000 if it had kept up with inflation. And
                    I was justsimply saying that that may suggest that the aggregate total regulationin the society may
                    have damaged our efficiency and our abilityto compete abroad and at home.</p>

                    written about and written about extensively—there is not time enough to go into other matters—and
                    Iwould refer to the speech you made at the University of Chicago onNovember 13, 1984.This picks up a
                    thread which you write about with repetitivenesson John Stuart Mill and his book on liberty and the
                    privatizationof morality away from governmental regulation. Picking up atpage 10, you write this:One
                    thinks of developments in free-speech doctrine in which it has been held thatgovernment may not, for
                    example, deal with obscenity and pornography except inthe most extreme cases because, as one opinion
                    puts it, cne man's vulgarity is anotherman's lyricThe Justice Harlan quotation that you referred to
                    otherwise.Then you go on to write:One notes in the rise of the so-called right-to-privacy cases
                    which deal mainlywith sexual morality and which generally conclude that sexual morality may be
                    regulatedonly in extreme cases. All of these trends, from interpretations of the religiousclauses,
                    to readings of the speech clause, to the privacy cases share thecommon theme that morality is not
                    usually the business of the government but is,instead, primarily the concern of the individual.
                    Whether or not so intended, thesecases may be seen as representing the privatization of morality.And
                    then you go on to talk about John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty"and as I read your writings—and I am
                    going to have to boil thisdown because of time limitations and ask you for your interpretation—you
                    seem to me to object to the privatization of morality andyou look for more governmental authority on
                    matters like pornographyas opposed to hardcore obscenity, which the first amendmentcannot reach. And
                    you look to more governmental regulation onmatters, as you put it, of sexual morality.You do not
                    like the stringent application of the establishmentclause and the free exercise clause which you
                    come to later on page11, that, as you articulate, the principles of majority
                    rule—Madisonianmajoritarianism, as you write so frequently—that you objectto the interpretations of
                    the law privatizing morality as it wouldapply in those cases—sexual conduct, speech, pornography and
                    religion.The thrust of my question is, where does that leave you in termsof sitting on the Supreme
                    Court, if confirmed, on enforcing majorityrule in a context where the Court has cut back very
                    sharply onState legislative activity in all of those lines?</p>

                    I—the reason I am sure I said this about theconflict between the clauses is that I was asking how
                    they couldhave got themselves to a point where, under the free exerciseclause, a State was required
                    to do what if it had done on its ownwould have violated the establishment clause.On page 7 and 8,
                    Senator, of that talk I discussed the case of Wisconsinv. Yoder and I was making the observation
                    which many professorshave made—my speeches get less original as I get busier; Itend to use other
                    people's thoughts—I made the point which othershave made that when the Supreme Court said that the
                    free exerciseclause required Wisconsin to make a special exception for theAmish to let their school
                    children out early before they were 16,that was an exception which if Wisconsin had made for the
                    Amishin its statute book would probably have been held to be a violationof the establishment
                    clause.It is a conventional point and it has been made by others manytimes before.</p>

                    vulgarity is another man's lyric underthe privatization concept.And then you move from that into the
                    discussion of the,". . . stringent application of the establishment clause"—this is atpage 11—"one

                    application of the free exercise clause to permitthe individual maximum freedom in his beliefs,"
                    which leads me tothe inference that you do not like the stringent application of establishmentor

                <p class="short_transcript">Judge Bork, as I was afraid I was going to runout of time, I have only got
                    four minutes left. So let me just makea few concluding observations.But I want to compliment you for
                    being so cooperative with thiscommittee. I believe that these hearings will set a new standard
                    forSupreme Court nominees, which I think is really important. Lastyear, on the record, I expressed
                    concern about the proceedings as toJustice Scalia not being able to get into issues.You came to talk
                    to me for more than 3 hours privately. Wewere interrupted on the first occasion by a vote, and I
                    have had theopportunity to question you for more than 3 hours now. Not that itis necessarily enough,
                    but you have been very generous with yourtime and, more than the generosity with your time, you have
                    beenin responsiveness.I think you have really dealt with the questions as best you canon very
                    complex subjects, not to say that all the answers are goingto please all of us, and I think you have
                    had tough questions, perhapsquestions at the belt—I don't think that they have been belowthe belt—by
                    the committee. Depending on your perspective orsomeone's perspective there might be some differences
                    to that, butyou have tried to respond to the questions.The hearings present a real opportunity for
                    the Senators to tellyou what is on our minds, and to tell you what is on the minds ofour
                    constituents, as we really expressed them, and the one opportunitywe have. And I know it is an
                    experience—I will remember it,and I am sure you will remember it.And when you talk, as you did,
                    about a powerful argument froma strong tradition, perhaps that will have some influence as
                    youconsider some of the doctrines, as you apply them in the future—on the Supreme Court, if
                    confirmed; and on the District of ColumbiaCourt, if you are not confirmed.Judge Bork, I have not
                    made up my mind on the confirmationprocess as of this moment. At the outset, I was very
                    concernedabout what I considered to be a sharp variance on your writings asopposed to the tradition
                    of U.S. constitutional jurisprudence.You have made significant shifts in accordance with this
                    testimonywhich I think, candidly, has to be evaluated. We don't expect aman to be in concrete on his
                    thinking, and I understand that whatyou had written in the past was speculative and tentative, and
                    Irespect that. And I also respect the consideration that law professors—you, as a professor, and
                    those today and those in the futurehave to be free to write in a vibrant, lusty manner without
                    beingconcerned that should they come to the Senate Caucus Room for aconfirmation proceeding that
                    they will be ruled out of considerationfor the Supreme Court of the United States.The issue of equal
                    protection of the laws is a very important one,and I think that—and I know that your testimony in
                    this room ismaterially different from what you had written. You had writtenthat equal protection
                    applied only in a racial context, and you havetestified here today about your willingness to apply
                    it to womenand to aliens and beyond race and ethnic consideration.We have questioned you at great
                    length, and there are few questionsand answers that I am going to reread, and that is one area.You
                    have testified extensively on the first amendment, and I havequestioned you extensively on the issue
                    of original intent andwhether you really can use original intent to decide the cases andwhether you
                    really can use legislative intent; and my suggestion toyou is that they only take you so far, and
                    beyond that you can relyon Cardozo or Frankfurter to effectuate the values and the traditionof the
                    people without being able to pull out a specific constitutionalright which would guarantee privacy.
                    And of course, youhave to decide that, if you are confirmed.If I had to boil down, perhaps, the crux
                    of an issue which I haveto think about, and we look for predictability, and you pose a veryunique
                    situation here because you have written more extensively, Ibelieve, than any nominee who has come to
                    this position. And wesearch for predictability, and that is our job.And personalities have to be put
                    aside. On this Senate JudiciaryCommittee we have a responsibility to uphold the Constitution, justas
                    you do as a judge, and the personalities are all out.And there is a question of what risk is
                    involved, risk to the Constitutionand risk to the Court, and that is a judgment which has tobe made.
                    When you and I talked extensively about Brandenburg v.Ohio and we traced the history of the Holmes
                    opinion on clear andpresent danger, and we went through Abrams and Git low andDennis to Brandenburg
                    and to Hess, and you said that you acceptedthe principle of Brandenburg and you would apply it but
                    you disagreedwith the philosophy.And a concern I have is that when the next set of facts comeup—and
                    they aren't going to be exactly like Brandenburg becauseno two cases are exactly alike on the
                    facts—if you disagree withthe philosophy, how will you decide the case. And you answered itI think
                    the only way a man can answer it: You are going to doyour best to uphold your oath of office and to
                    uphold the Constitutionand to uphold the principle of the Brandenburg case.I don't know that there
                    is any better answer that any man cangive, and, as a Senator on this panel, I have to weigh that.
                    Thatreally is an ultimate consideration.In closing, I would call your attention to the case of
                    Turner v.Saffley, which is a decision of the Supreme Court of the UnitedStates handed down on June
                    1, 1987, just a couple of months ago. Itinvolves the right of an inmate marriage regulation in the
                    Missourijails. And it is an opinion written by Justice O'Connor and itturns, as I read the case, on
                    due process grounds.And it holds that the Missouri inmate marriage regulation isunduly restrictive,
                    and it is joined in by Chief Justice Rehnquist,Justice Scalia, Justice White and Justice Powell.I
                    would say that to reach the level of a constitutional right on aninmate marriage regulation goes a
                    fair distance beyond what is articulatedin the Constitution of the United States. And I wouldhope
                    that, if you are confirmed, that there will be a broader viewthan specifically articulated rights in
                    the Constitution, the Cardozoview, the Frankfurter view, the O'Connor view, even the Rehnquistview
                    and the Scalia view; that it is really the needs of the nationwhich you articulate and you will
                    accept. And the commerceclause, I would hope as a Justice you would accept and articulate,if
                    confirmed, in a broader range of cases.I am not saying how you decide them because you may decidethe
                    right of privacy doesn't extend to abortion. But the authority ofthe Court to decide these
                    constitutional questions and the recognitionof rights which are not spelled out in minute detail
                    would beyour lodestone.Thank you very much, Judge Bork. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                    your record as a professor.And, as you told Senator Thurmond yesterday, and I quote: "In
                    theclassroom, no one gets hurt; in a courtroom, somebody always does,and that is a wholly different
                    function than being a professor."It appears that in your courtroom ordinary Americans have
                    frequentlybeen hurt. We heard about the sterilization case yesterday,and I would like to ask you
                    briefly about two other cases.The first is the Bartlett v. Bowen case in which you ruled that
                    asenior citizen could be kept out of court when her medicare benefitsare unconstitutionally denied.
                    Josephine Newman, of the ChristianScience faith, suffered from a terminal illness which
                    requiredskilled nursing care. She died and the executor of her estate filed amedicare claim, and the
                    claim was denied because she had earlierreceived medicare benefits for a previous stay in a
                    Christian Sciencefacility.Her executor, named Bartlett, brought a lawsuit claiming thatthe denial of
                    benefits violated her first amendment right to thefree exercise of religion, and your court ruled
                    that her estate wasentitled to pursue her claim in federal court and that the medicarelaw was not
                    intended to stop senior citizens from taking their constitutionalclaims to court.Judge Bork, you
                    dissented from that decision and ruled that asick, elderly American could be denied all access to a
                    federal courtto challenge an unconstitutional denial of her medicare benefits.My question is a
                    simple one. Aren't all Americans, includingsenior citizens, entitled to their day in court?</p>

                    if you hada claim for less than $1,000 you could not go to court. That seemedto me very clear. It is
                    flat on the face of the statute, and there isan ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity when the suit
                    is againstthe Federal Treasury that says Congress may deny access to courtsto make a claim against
                    the Federal Treasury.I would have been delighted to hear that case if the statutehadn't said she had

                    the case was raised under a constitutionalissue, under the free exercise clause. The court
                    majorityruled that the Congress did not cut off the judicial review whenconstitutional claims were
                    at issue. That is what the majorityruled, and I quote:"Challenges to the constitutionality of the
                    Medicare Act itselfmay be reviewed in federal court consistent with congressionalintent as expressed
                    in the Act."So the majority of the court found that the constitutional issueswere sufficiently
                    significant and important to consider, rather thanthe limitation of $1,000, which is written into

                    that that is what Congress had intended.Now I would like to ask you about your ruling on worker
                    safetyin the Prill case. Ken Prill was a truck driver with a good workrecord. After complaining
                    repeatedly about the unsafe conditions ofhis truck, Prill had an accident. His truck jack-knifed and
                    two vehiclesended up in a ditch, and the accident was caused by theunsafe condition of the truck,
                    not through any fault of Mr. Prill.And after complaining again to his supervisors, Mr. Prill went
                    tothe Tennessee Public Service Commission. The commission issued acitation to the company for
                    operating an unsafe vehicle; and forbringing this matter to the attention of the public agency, Mr.
                    Prillwas fired.Mr. Prill brought an unfair labor suit against his employer, anda majority of your
                    court supported his claim. You dissented fromthat opinion. You took the view that the labor laws do
                    not protecta worker in Mr. Prill's situation from reporting his unsafe truck tothe proper
                    authority.My question is simple. Why not?</p>

                    person acting was concerted activity. It is purely aquestion of statutory construction, with which I

                    satisfied by the fact that there wouldbe other drivers driving the truck and that the public
                    interest interms of using the highways would be affected.Well, Judge Bork, in my remarks yesterday I
                    emphasized theconcern that many of us have about, whether Judge Bork can befair if he becomes
                    Justice Bork and whether he has sufficientlygenuine commitment to the basic individual rights that
                    we have asAmericans and that are at the heart of our democracy and freedom.We are not a perfect
                    society, but the overwhelming majority ofAmericans are proud of the progress we have made in recent
                    decadesin making this a better land in achieving a greater measure ofracial justice and providing
                    genuine equality for women, in guaranteeingthe right to vote free from poll taxes and literacy
                    tests, andin protecting the basic liberties such as freedom of speech and freedomof religion, and in
                    some ways the most fundamental right ofall in a free society, the right to privacy and the right to
                    be freefrom intrusions by the government into the most fundamental andpersonal aspects of our
                    private lives.We are all aware of the enormous power that a Supreme CourtJustice has, and over the
                    past five days Judge Bork has shown usthat he is a brilliant lawyer. But the controversy over Judge
                    Borkis intense because Americans care very deeply about their basicrights, and we do not want to
                    risk the danger that Judge Bork willmisuse the Supreme Court as a platform to turn the clock and
                    requireus to refight the settled battles of the past.I want to close by quoting some words by the
                    man whose integrityand whose commitment to the rule of law cast such a longshadow over Judge Bork in
                    these proceedings. Archibald Cox declinedto testify here for reasons that all of us respect.
                    ProfessorCox cares deeply about the rule of law and he does not want this toappear to be a personal
                    contest between himself and Judge Bork.But in a new book that he has just finished, Archibald Cox
                    commentson the fundamental principle at issue in appointments tothe Supreme Court and other federal
                    courts, and I would like toread one brief passage from his book.To pack the bench with men and women
                    of a single narrow political ideology hasa tendency to erode long range public confidence in
                    judicial institutions. The legitimacyof judicial decrees depends on public confidence that the
                    judges are predominantlyengaged, not in making personal political judgments, but in applying a
                    bodyof law. The farther a President goes in proclaiming an intent to predetermine thecourse of
                    decisions, the more he will undercut the foundations of legitimacy. Theavowed selection of judges
                    whose minds are already closed on the cases that maycome before them in the future erodes the
                    respect and support for judicial rulingsthat flow from public confidence that cases submitted for
                    adjudication are being decidedby individuals with open minds as free as humanly possible from
                    political oreconomic self-interest, from the obligations of loyalty to a political party or
                    otherorganization, and from most forms of ambition.And I think that most Americans would agree with
                    ArchibaldCox, and I think most Americans would agree that the man whofired Archibald Cox does not
                    deserve to be promoted to Justice onthe Supreme Court.</p>

                    think that has to be pointed out.And anybody who doesn't understand that, doesn't understand thelaw.
                    And I think you well explained those two cases.Let me just you a couple of questions. I don't intend
                    to take allthe time. I have 15 minutes. Senator Simpson has 15 minutes.But it has been intimated
                    that a judge may not fairly apply astatute with which he disagrees or thinks pernicious. I must say
                    nojudge agrees with the policy of all the statutes he has to apply.Forexample, one would not say—I
                    don't think anyone would say thatJudge Abner Mikva, a colleague of yours on the court of appeals,and
                    a former Congressman, could not fairly interpret or apply alaw which he voted against as a
                    Congressman. I think anybodywould say he could not fairly do that. I wouldn't, and I don't thinkany

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I have it here, Senator. I think it is importantthat perhaps people
                    understand it.It was a case, as you know, involving a plant with a very highlead level in one
                    department. And the question was—and the companygave the women a choice, and the question was
                    whether thatwas a violation of the hazardous conditions policy of the OSHAAct.This was a case with
                    no satisfactory solution for anybody. Imean, there was just nothing to—there was no satisfactory way
                    tosolve it. Our court did not endorse the policy of the company. Thepolicy was to protect fetuses by
                    telling women that they—if theywanted to remain in the—they could not remain—if they
                    werechildbearing age, they could not remain in that department unlessthey were sterilized. But they
                    had a choice.That was a—that policy was not before us. We didn't have tochoose. The best solution
                    would have been to reduce the lead levels.I said that in the opinion. But the evidence before us
                    supported thefinding of the Commission, that the lead levels could not be furtherreduced. If you
                    tried to reduce them further, you would have toclose the department.So the company and the workers
                    were both faced with what Icalled in my opinion a most unhappy choice. Shut down the depart849merit,
                    which would put everybody out of work, including a lot ofwomen who had no—who were not of
                    childbearing age, and have adevastating effect, perhaps, on a lot of families in the area,
                    andchildren, or develop a policy that would protect women of childbearingyears.I would not want to
                    be an official of that company trying tomake that choice. I wouldn't want to be a worker faced with
                    thechoice. And fortunately, as judges, we were not faced with thatchoice.There were several statutes
                    that might have been involved, and Isaid in my opinion that there were other statutes that might
                    applybesides the OSHA Act, and, in fact, some other statutes—someother cases were brought on
                    that.The administrative Commission that was assigned by Congress tomake the decision found that the
                    law had not been violated. Andunder the terms of the statute, we were not free to overrule
                    thatdecision.So let me, if I may, just read from the opinion. I think it is importantthat people
                    understand what I decided.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">This is my opinion. It is important to understandthe context in which this
                    case arose and the task that is set for thiscourt. American Cyanamid found, and the administrative
                    law judgeagreed, that it could not reduce ambient lead levels in one of itsdepartments sufficiently
                    to eliminate the risk of serious harm to fetusescarried by women employees.The company was thus
                    faced with unattractive alternatives. Itcould remove all women of childbearing age from that
                    department,a decision that would have entailed discharging some of them andgiving others reduced pay
                    at other jobs, or the company could attemptto mitigate the severity of this outcome by offering
                    continuedemployment in the department to women who were surgicallysterilized. The company chose the
                    latter alternative, and thewomen involved were thus faced with a distressing choice. Somechose
                    sterilization, some did not.This is still continuing:As we understand the law, we are not free to
                    make a legislative judgment. Wemay not, on the one hand, decide that the company is innocent because
                    it chose tolet the women decide for themselves which course was less harmful to them, normay we
                    decide that the company is guilty because it offered an option of sterilizationthat the women might
                    ultimately regret choosing. These are moral issues of nosmall complexity, but they are not for us.
                    Congress has enacted a statute and ouronly task is the mundane one of interpreting its language and
                    applying its policy.Then I said at the end of the opinion:It is clear that American Cyanamid had to
                    prevent exposure to lead of women ofchildbearing age, and furthermore, that the company could not
                    have been chargedunder the Act if it accomplished that by discharging the women or simply by
                    closingthe department, thus putting all employees who worked there, including women ofchildbearing
                    age, out of work. The company was charged only because it offered thewomen a choice.Then I
                    said,Counsel for the union stated at oral argument that there would have been no violationif the
                    company had simply stated that only sterile women would be employedbecause there would have been no
                    requirement of" sterilization.We agree that such an announcement would not have involved aviolation
                    of the general duty clause of the statute, but we fail tosee how that policy differs under the
                    statute from the one AmericanCyanamid adopted. An "only sterile women" announcementwould also have
                    given women of childbearing age the option of surgicalsterilization.The only difference between that
                    case and this case is that herethe company pointed out the option and provided informationabout it.
                    It cannot be that the employer is better shielded from liabilitythe less information it provides.
                    The case might be differentif American Cyanamid had offered the choice in an attempt to passon to
                    its employees the cost of maintaining a lead concentrationhigher than that permitted by law. But
                    that is not this case. Thecompany could not reduce lead concentrations to a level that posedan
                    acceptable risk to fetuses.So the company offered this option, but not as an attempt to pass on
                    costs of unlawfulconduct, but to permit the employees to mitigate costs to them imposed
                    byunavoidable physiological facts. The women involved in this matter were putthrough a most unhappy
                    choice, but no statute regresses all grievances and we mustdecide cases according to law.I just
                    wanted to make it clear what that case held, Senator, becausethere is some thought that we approved
                    a policy. We did not.The only question was whether the Commission was correct in decidingthat this
                    particular statutory provision had not been violated,and we thought it was.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Well, it is odd to me after a dazzling 5 days of
                    listening, and ithas been an education and like going to law school for me in manyways. Because in
                    the private practice in Cody, Wyoming, for 18years, you really don't do too many constitutional
                    cases. Not manyat all.But really, to think that in the last day and a half we havetalked about
                    somehow that you favor sterilization of women, whatan absurd situation that we could get to in this
                    place? Triggerwords, charged words, high emotion—and somehow that you, if youhad your way, would
                    sterilize men and women in the UnitedStates. That is beyond my comprehension how we get to that,
                    butthat is what we do.And you remember when we started this I said, and it may beshocking but it is
                    sure real to me, you either pass or kill a bill andyou either confirm or reject an appointee to the
                    United States SupremeCourt apparently—didn't think it went this far, but it doesin legislation—by
                    using a deft blend of emotion, fear, guilt orracism. That is the way—I didn't think it worked with
                    SupremeCourt nominees. I knew it worked that way with legislation. Ifound that. But I didn't think
                    it went that far with this.And then, of course—and I shared it with you last night—to seethat the
                    dramatic telegram that was generated yesterday was doneby the attorney for the woman who called
                    her—and this lady wasthe lady attorney, Joan Bertin—called the woman and was her attorneyin the
                    Cyanamid case and told her to send a telegram to theSenate Judiciary Committee, and then Ms. Bertin,
                    the lawyer, preparedthe wire that we got and it says things like "Judge Borkthinks we were glad to
                    have the choice of getting sterilized or gettingfired. Only a judge who knows about women who need
                    to workcould say that".Then it says, "It's incredible. The judge, who is supposed to befair, can
                    support a company that doesn't follow the OSHA rules",and you have described all that. "It is the
                    most awful thing thathappened to me". It would have a greater ring of clarity if it wereprepared by
                    the person, but it was prepared by her attorney.And I said last night, and I say again, that when an
                    attorneyprepares the text of something like that and was the attorney forthe person and then to make
                    it look like some voluntary wire thatcame forward out of, you know, whatever, I think that is
                    offensiveto me.Well, let me share with you that, when I was in the WyomingLegislature we adopted a
                    thing called the Missouri Plan on the Selectionof judges. There was a reason for that. It was to
                    take judgesout of politics. We spent decades trying to get judges out of politics.It has happened
                    all over the United States. The States have gonefurther than, obviously, we have here, and that is
                    really sad.Because all this is, is politics right here. Nothing more, nothingless, not one whit. So
                    we tried to take them out of politics so theywouldn't have to go up by direct election, which they
                    did in manyStates—we appointed judicial selection committees, blue ribboncommittees—because we all
                    finally realized that judges who runfor the supreme court of the States or run for district court
                    judgeare not very good at the plant gate with pamphlets in their hand.They really don't cut the
                    mustard.They are not too good at rallies, either. Kind of don't get down tothe nub of things. They
                    are not very good at pumping hands in thestreets. We politicians like that. That is how we live.
                    That is ourlifeblood. That is our plasma.So we tried to remove judges from that all over the
                    UnitedStates, but not here in these proceedings. And you are deeply,deeply in politics here. Nothing
                    more, nothing less. Let no one misswhat is happening. And we will never come this way again.I am as
                    excited about my ability to participate in this as ArlenSpecter has indicated. We will never see it
                    again. This will neverhappen again. Doesn't matter whether you are confirmed or rejected.Because the
                    next time we have a Supreme Court nominee he orshe will say: "There is a limitation to my response
                    to this committee,and I do not believe as a nominee I can tell you how I mightvote on a particular
                    issue which may come before the Court or endorseor criticize specific Supreme Court decisions
                    presenting issueswhich may well come before the Court again"; or "How I might resolvea particular
                    issue or what I might do in a future Court actionmight make it necessary for me to disqualify myself
                    on the matterand that would result in my inability to do my sworn duty, namely,to decide cases that
                    come before the Court"; or to say "I suggestthat none of us really know how we would resolve any
                    particularissue. At the very least, we would reserve judgment at that time,and I will not discuss
                    how the statute will be interpreted in thefuture." Those are the remarks of Justice O'Connor at her
                    confirmation.Justice Scalia said."I do not think I should, Senator, respond tothe question because
                    that may well be an issue argued before theCourt and I do not want to be in the position of having
                    in connectionas a condition of my confirmation giving an indication of howI would come out on it."
                    And the Senator responded: "I understandthat." And that question was then shunted aside.Then Judge
                    Scalia said, as anyone will in the future and hasalways in the past, say, "I just cannot do it, and
                    I think the onlyway to be sure that I am not impairing my ability to be impartial,and to be regarded
                    as impartial in future cases before the Court, issimply respectfully decline to give an opinion on
                    whether any ofthe existing law on the Supreme Court is right or wrong." Andthat was the end of that
                    line of questioning. That was it. Schoolwas out.And then Judge Rehnquist, and I am only citing the
                    most recentthree, he said: "Senator, I was reluctantly willing to answer yourquestions about the
                    first amendment questions. I am a good dealmore reluctant to venture an answer that would be any
                    sort of abroader classification. In effect, I must say I am very much inclinedto think that I best
                    ought not."That is the rest of our history right there, so we will never seethis again. But what we
                    have seen, again, is more of the authenticman or woman than we will ever see in a Supreme Court
                    Justicenominee, and that has been exciting.So I guess that next time and every time before we would
                    havethe same answers to the same questions, and especially they willbe accepted by us, as they have
                    in the past, and the sad thing isthat we will not get a chance to really deal—and they will be
                    moreaccepted by us if they have written nothing, done nothing and saidnothing.Is not that a
                    tragedy?We will get—you know, I do not know what we will get. Hopefullywe will do well—and I think
                    we will—under any future President—but we will never get the yeast and the zip that we have
                    hadhere.The Indiana Law Journal, this remarkable piece—well, youknow, I referred to that. And what
                    you said about it. You said itwas a general theory. You said it was ranging shots. You said itwas an
                    attempt to stimulate. You said it is informal, presented in853formally, as original remarks and
                    lectures. "I did not think itworthwhile to convert these speculations and arguments into anyheavily
                    researched, balanced and thorough presentation," youwrote.You said that, but nobody has ever talked
                    about that. Not once.And at the end of the article, you said it was tentative and exploratory,and
                    they have been hammering you with that thing for 5days. Well, I think it will be a good lesson to
                    anyone that thinks ofwanting to be on the Supreme Court, and I am sure there areyoung people and
                    young lawyers and non-lawyers who would liketo be on the Supreme Court.It would be interesting, too,
                    whether they have had their goal alittle chilled in this process. That would be interesting for me
                    toknow.But anyway, we are searching for predictability. I think that wasa fair phrase and you
                    ascribed to it. We are not searching for perfection.Everyone of us at this table have flunked that
                    test, period.All of us, some publicly, some privately, but all of us, all 14 haveflunked the test of
                    perfection.Some may say that they have not, but they may believe it, but Ido not believe it. So I
                    will not tell about being on federal probationfor shooting those mail boxes when I was 18. I will
                    leave that out.[Laughter.]Then, you know, assault and battery charge when I was in theUniversity of
                    Wyoming, it was not my fault. [Laughter.]In those days I weighed 260 and had hair and thought beer
                    wasfood and was omnipotent. [Laughter.]And I have got the scars on my head to show for that. And
                    thatis the way it is. It is called real life, and there is not anybody thatdoes not understand that,
                    nowhere.Well, I did have some questions, but even though my good friendfrom Utah was good enough to
                    toss me a little extra time, I justwanted to—there was one area that needed just a swift answer,and
                    that is the area of the Human Life Bill. It seemed to me whenyou testified against that, it was a
                    classic example of not lettingyour personal preferences influence your interpretation. Was thatnot
                    what that was?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Well, I will conclude. But there is an old poemthat I—and hang on tight
                    because I am not going to go into romance—but the poem "If by Rudyard Kipling is a dandy, and ifyou
                    read it when you are 21 and then read it about every 5 yearsafterwards, it has ever more meaning as
                    you chamber it inside ofyourself.Just a couple of lines from that. Of course, the openers are
                    thegreatest ones for you:If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming
                    it onyou; if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you and yet make allowance fortheir doubting,
                    too; if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied aboutdon't deal in lies, or being
                    hated, don't give way to hating, and yet don't look toogood nor talk too wise.That is good stuff.
                    And it is all good stuff. But the other one is:If you can bear to hear the truth you have spoken
                    twisted by knaves to make atrap for fools; or watch the things you gave your life too broken and
                    stoop and buildthem up with worn out tools;and so it is, and:If you can walk with crowds and keep
                    your virtue, or walk with kings nor lose thecommon touch; if neither foes nor loving friends can
                    hurt you; if all men count withyou, but none too much.and, of course:If you can fill the unforgiving
                    minute with 60 seconds worth of distance run,yours is the earth and all that is in it; and what is
                    more, you will be a man, my son.It is a good one. I read it to my three children and it seems
                    topicaland important here.And I have one final question. Why do you want to be an AssociateJustice
                    of the United States Supreme Court?</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Senator, I guess the answer to that is that I havespent my life in
                    intellectual pursuits in the law and since I havebeen a judge, I particularly like the courtroom. I
                    liked the courtroomas an advocate, and I like the courtroom as a judge, and Ienjoy the give and take
                    and the intellectual effort involved.It is just a life—and that is, of course, the court that has
                    themost interesting cases and issues, and I think it would be an intellectualfeast just to be there
                    and to read the briefs and discussthings with counsel and discuss things with my colleagues. That
                    isthe first answer.The second answer is, I would like to leave a reputation as ajudge who understood
                    constitutional governance and contributedhis bit to maintaining it in the ways I have described
                    before thiscommittee. Our constitutional structure is the most importantthing this nation has and I
                    would like to help maintain it and to beremembered for that.</p>

                <strong>Robert H. Bork</strong>
                <p class="short_transcript">All right, Senator.Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, this has been a
                    long,detailed, and often a profoundly interesting four and a half days ofhearings. And I want to
                    thank you personally Mr. Chairman forthe courtesies you have personally extended to me and to
                    myfamily during this week.I also want to thank all the members of the committee for theirpatience,
                    their attention, and their general good humor throughoutthese proceedings. For that I am most deeply
                    grateful.I have over the past four and a half days been asked a number ofprobing, highly complex and
                    thoughtful questions covering a verybroad range of subjects. I have answered those questions
                    truthfully,openly and to the fullest extent possible without crossing the linethat would place me in
                    a position of speaking to specific mattersthat might come before either court.If you have noted,
                    there are views I have testified to here thatreaffirm my acceptance of a body of jurisprudence as
                    establishedand no longer judicially assailable, notwithstanding, that has developedin a manner
                    different from a direction I had suggested someyears ago. At the same time, there is much in my
                    earlier writings—most particularly, my views on the proper role of judges andthe need for faithful
                    adherence to the text and the discernible intentionsof the ratifiers of the Constitution and
                    statutes—that Isubscribe to just as fully today as I did before.As a consequence, I have received
                    criticism in some quarters forbeing too rigid and criticism in other quarters for being
                    inconsistentor self-contradictory. Neither charge is, in my opinion, an accurateone. As I said to
                    you in my opening statement, I am a juristwho believes his role is to interpret the law and not to
                    make it.If the members of the committee are looking, as you have saidyou are, for predictability, it
                    is certainly predictable that I willadhere to my judicial philosophy as I have described it in
                    thesehearings and elsewhere. That may lead on occasion to results thatconservatives applaud and on
                    other occasions to results that liberalsapplaud, but in either event, it will not be because of some
                    personalpolitical agenda of my own. It will not be a desire to set asocial agenda for the nation. It
                    will be because the result, in myconsidered judgment, is required by the law.On that point, let me
                    simply add, as I also did in my openingstatement, that when I say "the law," I regard precedent as
                    an importantcomponent of the law. As I have described many timeshere, there are a number of
                    important precedents that are today sowoven into the fabric of our system that to change or alter
                    themwould be, in my view, unthinkable.Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, you have myrecord
                    before you. It shows not only a full sensitivity toward minoritiesand women, but a consistent record
                    favoring the interestsof minorities and women. I have given you my full view of theequal protection
                    clause. It means what the words say: "All personsare protected against unreasonable legislative
                    classifications."You have heard me testify under oath, and I take an oath as avery serious and
                    affirmative thing. I have affirmed my full acceptanceof the Supreme Court's first amendment
                    jurisprudence, includingthe Brandenburg decision, and I have affirmed by full ac856ceptance of the
                    incorporation doctrine, and there are many otherareas in which that is true.I have tried to be
                    responsive to your questions. I hope I have succeeded.But to the extent any members have further
                    questions, Iwill be glad to answer them at a later time.Again, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you and
                    the members ofthis committee.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Mr. Chairman, thank you.Mr. Chairman, what we have been seeking these past 5
                    daysfrom Judge Bork are certain things, certain things for us to determine.Among those are knowledge
                    of the law. In these exchangesand discussions with the members of this committee on both sidesof the
                    aisle, this man, Mr. Chairman, has demonstrated a most formidable—nay, almost an awesome—knowledge.
                    Surely even yourmost severest detractors just have to be impressed. There is no waythat cannot
                    be.Number two, clarity of expression in your explanations of yourdecisions, your views, and of the
                    Constitution, and you have explainedto us some very complex and difficult concepts. And youhave done
                    that in a way that is so clear that not only those of us inthis room, those members of the
                    committee, but many of our fellowAmericans have received a veritable primer in constitutional
                    law.And I notice you have that little book in front of you a good deal ofthe time. It looks a little
                    well-thumbed to me.You know it. You really do know it, the Constitution. And whatan appropriate time
                    for your appointment when many people inthe United States are reading it for the first time, just
                    because ofthis year. And I think that is remarkable, too.Then a willingness and a capacity to work
                    hard, and that issomething that is impressive to me. And another thing, you couldhave gone
                    professorial on us at any point in time. You could havedone that, become a bit pedantic and lectury,
                    and you did not dothat. In fact, I do not believe I saw one time when you spoke orgave an answer
                    over 3 minutes, and then you deferred to the questionerand said, I hope I am not taking your time.I
                    think the only time you ever used the phrase, quote, "On theother hand," unquote, was in jest or
                    good humor. And let me tellyou, that was interesting to watch for me.So you have had this
                    willingness and you have let us see yourwritings and your speeches and your written decisions. You
                    haveshown this tremendous willingness to work—it is an extraordinarywillingness to work diligently,
                    and we have seen this capacity thatyou have to be here over these past 5 days while it has
                    probablyworn some of us out.We are 14 and we had a 4 or 5 hour break between our rounds,and there
                    you are. And that is extraordinary. And always donewithout a shred of impatience or irritation when
                    we all know thatit obviously had to be there. So I think that is impressive to me.Then judicial
                    temperament—what we always seek here—in theface of what has been referred to as fierce attacks,
                    ferocious attacks,in the face of dramatic presentations, either in the form ofwriting or audio, and
                    the reading of things from others. That hasbeen interesting. And in that you have displayed the very
                    essenceand epitome of patience and courtesy and good humor which in mybook is the definition of
                    judicial temperament.I have seen judges who really fired some lightening bolts fromthe bench at me
                    and others in the courtroom. They lost their respectof lawyers in the process. And I am a spirited
                    person myself,but I always felt of myself as an officer of the court and couldalways put aside my
                    personal views.Then, finally, your views and your philosophy. In response afterresponse we have
                    heard Robert Bork express, explain, discuss hisviews and his philosophy. And, again, not in the
                    manner of thepedant or the lecturer or the professor but as what I see as anunthreatened man. Under
                    oath, answering questions, often thesame ones, over and over and over again in a very measured
                    andthoughtful way. I was impressed by that.As I say, I do not think we will ever see it happen
                    again, regardlessof what happens here. We will never see this again, becausethey will all say, no
                    need to go through that. You do not have to.You do not have to do that.And so in my mind, Mr.
                    Chairman, such a person as this nomineewill not pass this way again and former Chief Justice
                    Burgerwas correct. I feel this is one of the finest nominees that we havehad to this Court in 50
                    years, and it just seems difficult to imaginewhy at least a majority of our colleagues in the United
                    StatesSenate who will read this transcript and see your responses cannothelp but realize what a
                    remarkable opportunity we have here toplace a very unique and extraordinary man on the United
                    StatesSupreme Court.I thank you, Mr. Chairman.</p>

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.I am delighted to take these last few
                    minutes. Over the last 5days we have been judging a judge. Really, during that gruelingtime you have
                    answered every question. In my mind you have dispelledevery doubt, you have risen above every insult
                    or indignity—and there have been some—you have disposed of every complaint.I think this morning has
                    been particularly interesting becauseyou have had two very brilliant legal minds asking questions
                    toyours, among others. But I particularly enjoyed Senator Heflin andSenator Specter and the erudite
                    way they have asked questions ofyou and have expected equally erudite answers.As I said at the
                    outset of this trial, the standard for judgmenthas been political, and you have not been judged by
                    your faithfulnessto the law but by your critics' fidelity to politics or to a politicalagenda.A
                    judge is not a political officer and should not be measured bypolitical standards and should not
                    have to make campaign promises,and I have been impressed that you haven't made any. Youhave said
                    what you believe, you have said what you are going todo, and I think it has certainly been very,
                    very good.I think you have forthrightly answered every question, and someof them four and five
                    times, and you have done it with patience. Byany standard of fairness, however, it seems to me the
                    judgmentwould have to be reported in your favor.If this body could rise above political measurements
                    and be halfas fair to you as you have been as a judge to others, then I thinkthe verdict would be
                    unquestionably rendered in your favor, and Ithink it will be in the end.But just look at your
                    record. Take women's rights. They have indicatedthat maybe you might endanger the equal rights of
                    women,but what is a fair judgment? The judgment is, and from your statementshere and from your
                    record as a judge and as a Solicitor Generaland your actions, you would grant us much or more
                    protectionas the Supreme Court does, with great fidelity to the words of theConstitution itself.The
                    Constitution, of course, guarantees any person equal protectionof the law, and you have reinforced
                    that. You have proven thison the bench by your actions, by expanding women's rights underthe Equal
                    Pay Act and other statutes, and we have brought thosecases out.On privacy, they thought maybe you
                    would endanger privacyrights. Well, your actions speak louder than words. You would enforceall
                    privacy rights in the Constitution and you would strengthenthe ability of Congress and the President
                    to enforce any othersthat they choose to enact or choose to define. I think this is provenby your
                    writing the opinion in the Dronenberg case, and I thinkthat can't help but be considered by our
                    colleagues.With regard to free speech, are you going to only protect politicalspeech? Well, you have
                    made that clear by your actions. You havealready protected commercial speech in the Williamson
                    Tobaccocase, scientific speech in the McBride case, artistic and expressivespeech in the Quincy
                    Cable case.You know, would you narrow speech protections? What is thefair judgment on that? Well,
                    you have already expanded speechprotections beyond that of the Supreme Court in the famousOilman
                    case that you decided that now the Supreme Court hasadopted.So, really, what about overturning many
                    precedents? You havemade it clear you would not do that. You have been so in tune withthe Supreme
                    Court that in 423 cases that you have voted on, notone has been reversed.Whether or not they have
                    been listened to by the SupremeCourt, they have rejected certiorari; they have not been appealedin
                    some instances because the quality of your judging was so good.That is the point, after
                    all.Moreover, the Supreme Court has taken every one of your dissentsover the majority of your
                    brethren and has adopted them astheir opinions. That is something nobody should ignore. It is
                    reallysomething.With regard to Archibald Cox, my gosh, that doesn't even deserveto hear much comment
                    about because you followed throughon Watergate and were primarily responsible for having that
                    comeout to the effective conclusion that it did because that investigationthat you backed up led to
                    a President's resignation and severalprosecutions, as you know, plus you were instrumental in
                    gettingLeon Jaworski to do it. And as much as I admire Archibald Cox,there is no question Jaworski
                    really did the job, and where is thecompliment for that?Well, all I can say is you have wiped away
                    any claims that youwould sustain poll taxes or literacy tests. You have expanded civilrights in
                    almost every case that you have had before you and youhave enforced every civil rights statute that
                    you have faced andseveral others as well.On the racially-restrictive covenants, you argued the case
                    that finallycreated a federal remedy for racially-discriminatory privatecontracts in the Runyon v.
                    McCrary case.You could go on and on, and let me just finish with these comments,and that is this: A
                    lot of people have said minorities shouldbe afraid of Judge Bork. Well, the fair judgment should be
                    this:Should we fear a judge who strongly enforced voting rights inSouth Carolina in the Sumter
                    County case?Should we fear a judge who outlawed sex discrimination in theState Department in the
                    Palmer case? Should we fear a judge whogave equal pay to stewardesses and other women in the
                    Laffeycase? Should w&amp; fear a judge who outlaws discrimination in militarypromotions in the Emory
                    case?Should we fear a judge who protected the due process rights of ahomosexual in the Doe case?
                    Should we fear a judge who won protectionsagainst private discriminatory contracts and covenants
                    inthe Runyon case? Should we fear a judge who went beyond the SupremeCourt in protecting against
                    pregnancy discrimination in theGilbert case, and should we fear a judge who went beyond the
                    SupremeCourt in promoting free speech rights in the libel cases?Well, I don t think so.I would
                    conclude with these remarks: You have been very open,you have answered all these questions. I agree
                    with Senator Simpson;it is never going to happen again. Nobody has been as open,nobody has put
                    themselves forth as much as you have.When these hearings began, the opposition accused you of
                    beingtoo rigid because they felt judges should be bound by the rule oflaw as well as those judged.
                    You were too rigid because your mindwas closed to new ideas and the rights of minorities, they
                    said.When they could produce absolutely no good evidence to supporteither claim, we began to hear a
                    new allegation that you are tooflexible; that you are too open to suggestions from this body.Indeed,
                    a judge who is bound by the law ought to be open tolearn from the lawmakers, but these lawmakers
                    ought to learn onecritical lesson from this great jurist, and that is the lesson of fairness. In
                    fairness, this body should provide no other verdict thanthat supported by the evidence, and that is
                    the verdict of a magnificentperformance.Finally, every person is entitled to his or her own opinion,
                    but noperson is entitled to his or her own facts. The so-called facts usedagainst you are totally
                    manufactured by people who have made uptheir own facts out of the vacuums of their own minds.To be
                    honest with you, I have really been disturbed by the attacksthat have come upon you, and it reminds
                    me of a quote byAlbert Einstein. He said great spirits have always found violent oppositionfrom
                    mediocrities.I think you are a great spirit, you are a great judge, you are agreat legal mind. You
                    are not only in the mainstream; you havegot a lot of companionship there from the other great legal
                    mindsthat we all admire in this century from the left to the right, and Iwant to compliment you for
                    the way you have handled yourselfand I hope our colleagues will read this record and pay strict
                    attentionto it, and I have no doubt that you will be confirmed if theywill.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                <p class="short_transcript">Thank you, Senator.Judge, I won't trespass on your time very long. Let me
                    begin bythanking your wife and your daughter and your two sons. I hopethat you and your family have
                    not felt you have been confrontedby, to use Senator Hatch's words, opposing prosecutors.But
                    nonetheless, I am sure that, no matter how fairly or unfairlyyou feel the hearing was conducted or
                    my colleagues may characterizeit that, it is nonetheless difficult for your family to sit thereunder
                    those lights for so long.I have found in my limited experience of holding public office for17 years
                    that it is a lot harder on one's family than it is on theprincipal when a member of the family is
                    undergoing any test.You have been undergoing a test, but that is part of the process,as you well
                    know, Judge. No judge, no nominee is entitled to thespot, nor have you ever implied you thought you
                    were, merely becauseyou have been nominated.It is as much a responsibility of the nominee to prove
                    why he orshe should be on the Court. It is not a presumption automaticallymade any more than it is a
                    presumption when one of us stands forelection that we should be elected. That is the process.As I
                    said at the outset of this, I viewed my role as Chairman ofthis committee as not to persuade, not to
                    attempt to persuade mycolleagues, and obviously colleagues on both sides have attemptedto persuade.
                    You have heard two very persuasive closing argumentsas to why you should be on the bench.My
                    function, as I have viewed it, is not to persuade, but to bepart of assuring that all the issues
                    were laid out; that you had afull and fair and thorough opportunity to respond, and to initiateany
                    point that you wished to make.T hope you feel that has been done.</p>

                    everything,and my colleagues have all agreed, to protect any inquiryinto that area. There is nothing

                <p class="short_transcript">And they could have; they have done it before toother people. If this were
                    going to be pure politics, I think it wouldhave been a little bit different, but it is not, because
                    you are anhonorable and decent man. There is nothing in your backgroundthat I have seen that in any
                    way indicates that you are not, interms of your character, fit to serve on any court in any position
                    inthis country.So I hope that when all the dust settles, when you are either onthe court—well, you
                    will be on the court, on the circuit court or theSupreme Court—you will look back on this process
                    and at leastfind some solace in the fact that none of that has occurred, nor willit as long as I am
                    chairman of this committee.The second point I would like to make to you is that I think it isfair to
                    say that those of us who have taken issue with your philosophy,your judging philosophy, to use your
                    phrase, have not, as waspredicted, been single-issue people.When you were nominated, this was
                    allegedly supposed to be agreat debate between pro-life and pro-choice, a great debate on allthe
                    other issues that the interest groups are out there talkingabout.But the fact of the matter is, I
                    think it is fair to say, that mycolleagues on both sides of the aisle have not—they have askedabout
                    all those things, but I think it is hard to suggest that thathas been a focus, a single issue.I
                    think this is about principle, not about whether you are principled—you are principled—but about
                    whether or not your principledview of judging and how you interpret the Constitution is
                    consistentwith the principles that others of us have regarding thatfunction and responsibility.You
                    have been very straightforward about how you view that interpretationof the Constitution. You have
                    confused me a couple oftimes, and I acknowledge part of that may be because I have notfully followed
                    you, not because you intentionally meant to confuseme.Other times, I think we may have confused you
                    a little bit, butone thing has come through for me throughout your testimony. Ihave been surprised a
                    little bit about your development of yourviews on the due process clause. "Surprised" is too strong;
                    I havebeen interested.I have been interested in your fleshing out further than you everhad before
                    your views on precedent—I think it is fair to say morethan you ever have in public before. I have
                    found them interesting—not provocative, but interesting—and I have to let it sinkthrough my mind as
                    to how I determine how consistent they arewith what has been said before and what you say now.Again,
                    it is fully possible that they are totally consistent. I havenot all sifted through all of it yet. I
                    thought you were going to gosome ways you did not go, and you went other ways I did notthink, which
                    again is what these hearings were about from theoutset.But a rock-bottom principle, I think it is
                    fair to say, remainswith you, and that is on choices of fundamental principle, decisionscannot be
                    made by the court where constitutional material doesnot clearly specify the value to be preferred;
                    judges can't go off anddo that. There is no principled way to prefer any claimed humanvalue over any
                    other unless you find it in the text or the history ofthe Constitution, as I understand you.You have
                    written, and I think it is consistent with what youhave said, that the truth is what the majority
                    thinks it is at anygiven moment, precisely because the majority is permitted togovern and to
                    redefine its values constantly consistent with theConstitution.Now, I believe—I want to choose my
                    adjectives properly here so Idon't in any way in this closing statement misrepresent by
                    implicationanything you have said. Just let me say what I think.I think the Constitution is more
                    expansive than I think you readit, and I think judges have more latitude and should have
                    morelatitude than you think they should. I believe that the Constitution—well, from the Magna Carta
                    to the Constitution, 800 years ofEnglish jurisprudential history, 900 years, have produced an
                    abiding,consistent notion that I am who I am because I am, not becausean}' constitution tells
                    me.When we delegated rights to a government, we expressly saidthat the ones set out as protecting in
                    the Bill of Rights doesn'tcount them all. That ninth amendment, to me, is, and should be,expansive.
                    I acknowledge it hasn't been used that way, but I thinkit should be.I think it is necessary for an
                    emerging society that is going to befaced with conflicts that are going to exceed those which we
                    found,in my view, social conflicts, at any time in our history in the next20 years.As I said, I
                    believe we are just born with certain rights as a childof God having nothing to do with whether or
                    not the State or theConstitution acknowledges I have those rights; that they are givento me and you
                    and each of our fellow citizens by a creator and itrepresents the essence of our human dignity, and
                    even if the Constitutionattempted to move them, I would still have them.I agree with Justice Harlan,
                    as we all have quoted Harlan. Youhave quoted him in agreeing with him; everyone here has quotedhim.
                    I agree with Justice Harlan—as we have all pointed out, oneof the most distinguished conservative
                    Justices of our era—whostated that the Constitution is a "living thing."And I acknowledge you
                    believe it is a living thing as it relates towhether you can find a textual basis for the principle
                    in the firstplace, and you cite often, and I think forthrightly and which separatesyou from some
                    other originalist folks, the fourth amendment.You say, look, if it weren't a living thing, you
                    wouldn't be able tooutlaw wire taps. Obviously, they didn't think of wire taps backwhen they were
                    talking about search and seizure. You expand it,but you must find it in the text first.And I think
                    the Constitution and its protections are enshrined inmajestic phrases like "equal protection under
                    the law" and "dueprocess," and thus cannot be, as Harlan said, "reduced to any formula."It is, as
                    Chief Justice John Marshall said, and I quote, "The Constitutionis intended to endure for ages to
                    come, and consequentlyto be adapted to the various crises of human affairs. Only its greatoutlines
                    are marked."In the end, Judge, whatever my reaction or anyone else's reactionto your testimony here,
                    which has been long, I think it is fairto say we have tried to move it as fast as we could, but it
                    has nonethelessbeen long and, I think, thorough.And I agree with my colleagues; you have done your
                    best toanswer. You have not attempted to step back and say, "I can'tspeak to that issue." And I hope
                    the confirmation process has beenserved well, and I hope that in our debate, our discussions—andthe
                    debate will take place on the floor of the United States Senatebecause it is my intention for your
                    nomination to get to the floor ofthe United States Senate.I hope that what we have done a little bit
                    of, although none of usis trained as you have been, to the extent you have been in thelaw—I hope our
                    discussions have demonstrated to our fellow citizensthe majesty of the Constitution. I hope they
                    have demonstratedthe greatness that we think the American people require ofthose who interpret the
                    Constitution.Let me conclude, Judge, by saying that I do not find you to beracist or insensitive.I
                    find you to be a very bright man who has done his best to let usknow what he thinks in a complicated
                    set of principles and areasthat we have discussed, and who has a view of constitutional
                    interpretationand judging that is different than mine.And there are some things I have to go back
                    and look at now,and that is to what degree, to how much of a degree, that exists,and I will do that.
                    And we will listen to testimony from others overthe next couple weeks.It is still my intention,
                    Judge, to move this along as rapidly andas fast as possible, but I can't guarantee you when we will
                    finish.We are shooting to finish this hearing so we can vote on October1st, but I think it is fair
                    to say we may not be able to make that,although that is our intention, based on when and to what
                    degreewitnesses are available.But, Judge, we are going to keep the record open for my colleagueswho
                    may wish to ask you questions in writing, as you haveagreed to earlier, but we will not burden you
                    with many, I hope. Atleast my effort will be to see that that doesn't happen, and therewill be
                    plenty of time before this hearing is over for you to answerthem.So, Judge, I say to my colleagues I
                    want to thank them, and Iwant to thank you. Senator Hatch, you are not going to get the lastword
                    now. I am the Chairman, I just want you to know.</p>
